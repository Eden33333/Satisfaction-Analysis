I also suggested that everyone wear sports shoes that fit better, because the road in Tulou is uneven and full of potholes, which can easily cause foot pain. It is important to wear comfortable shoes. Although the road on Gulangyu Island is not like the earth building, it has a lot of uphill and downhill slopes and the walking is quite difficult, so don’t bring anything you don’t need and get to the island easily. There are many delicious food on Longtou Road, but hygiene is very important. You must choose a clean and hygienic store. There are more seafood and the price is not expensive. Those who like to eat seafood will be in luck. Xiamen University’s opening hours are regulated, but our tour guide Lin Shanshan arranged it very reasonably. Before the opening of Xiamen University, he took us to visit Nanputuo. The explanation was very detailed and we listened with gusto. Then let us have free time to visit Xiamen University. We went to Furong Tunnel, which has many interesting paintings. The tunnel is very long and we didn’t finish it. I also went to Zengcuoan, which also has a lot of delicious food. I don’t need to wear a lot of clothes in Xiamen. I just wear a bottoming shirt and a sweatshirt, which is enough, and a pair of pants. But it’s still a bit cold in the morning and evening, so you still need to put on more clothes because it will get hotter as soon as the sun comes out. The sun is quite strong, so you must bring sunscreen. If you have time, you can make a guide in advance, so that you can also use your time in the evening to go shopping, eat snacks, and see the night view. There are many local buses, and it is very convenient to take the bus out by yourself after the group breaks up. Overall, I had a lot of fun in Xiamen. I hope everyone has to help.",Postive

Patiently introduce and lead in detail😊I experienced a lot of scenery...the seaside, the mountains, the alleys...the sound of the piano, the sound of the wind, the voices of people...the dilapidated courtyards, the prosperous doors and windows...flowers, grass, trees...everything is covered in the sun. A layer of warm light. Throughout the trip, there are twists and turns, going around and around, coming randomly. Maybe by accident, it is the old house you hope to encounter, or you may have heard people say that oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar are good for parents.

2,2,"The whole trip was relaxing and free. On the first day, we were at Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. There were many Xiamen snacks and seafood restaurants, including bamboo shoot jelly, fried oysters, and five-spice rolls. They were great! . The next day we went to Fujian Tulou and Yunshuiyao according to the itinerary. The journey was long and the road to the Tulou was uneven. It is recommended that you wear suitable sports shoes. Yunshuiyao Scenic Area is a very suitable place for walking. There are Hakka Tulou, century-old banyan trees, and... There are ancient paths paved with cobblestones. It is indeed a pleasure to stroll along the cobblestone-covered stream, watch the gurgling water, the slow-walking white ducks, the weeping banyan trees and the weeping willow trees, and feel the fresh and natural pastoral scenery. On the third day, we went to Gulangyu Island according to the itinerary and took a ferry across the Lujiang Strait. It was very comfortable. We also went to the Shell Museum and Shuzhuang Garden. There are more seafood and the price is not expensive. Those who like to eat seafood will be in luck.

3,3,"Get here early on the first day and you can ride a yellow car or take the subway to Zhongshan Road for a tour (luxury goods and various snacks). Went to Tulou the next day. The tour guide Zhuang Changhuang took us the next day. There were more than 20 families and more than 50 people who took us there. It was amazing. The introduction was very careful, humorous, polite, and humane. It was the first time I saw it. A tour guide will think of the hard work of the bus driver. Before going to the tulou, he will think of mosquito bites and apply something to prevent mosquito bites for each of us. There are too many tourists, so you can only tour around on the first floor because the building cannot support too much weight. On the second and third days, there were more than 30 people. Instead, the tour guide took us and introduced us to various must-eat and delicious gourmet restaurants. There were also many useful things recommended to us, and historical explanations, etc. Wait, we are reminded that the three skewers of squid for 10 yuan cannot be eaten. They are soaked in formalin... To be honest, I was ""tempted"" by the color and aroma of the squid several times. goodgood. Four days in Xiamen is enough. It was just that the last two days were gray, with light and moderate rain, and no sunrise could be seen. The main reason to come to Xiamen is to eat! …It’s best to come on a sunny day. …The kids here are simply the prototypes in Hayao Miyazaki’s animations, their voices and intonations are exactly the same. The huge number of cats on Gulangyu Island at night reminds me of ""The Cat's Repayment of Kindness"". You can add money to experience living on the island. The second and third floors of the Jingyu Hotel on the island are KTVs of the same brand. It was very noisy and sang until 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning. Everyone who stayed in this hotel in a car did not sleep well the next day... I originally wanted to change hotels, so I talked to the customer service After moving the business, the 3rd floor was moved to the 6th floor, and there was no noise. The after-sales service of Tongcheng was very good. Food (the tour guide will recommend brands): nougat, milk tea, rice rolls, grass jelly, Turkish ice cream (there are few people after 20:00, the guy is confident and handsome, great), rice dumplings, sand tea noodles, local Bamboo shoot jelly (it has sandworms inside and tastes like fish jelly. Southerners say they are not used to it. They saw the Fujianese eat it in just a few bites), the student canteen of Xiamen University (very cheap, with many varieties and delicious, You can ask classmates from Xiamen University to swipe your card), and there are many varieties of fruits: thorn melon tastes good (like jelly, the seeds should not be eaten), black banana (2 pieces/piece) is quite sweet, and custard apple (more than 20 pieces/piece) is delicious , but quite expensive; small pineapple (sweet); small lotus mist (particularly not delicious...the ginger tastes bitter. 10 yuan/skewer, 3 pieces); red guava (the skin has a ginger flavor and the red part It's okay, the seeds are super hard and crunchy... It's like eating small pebbles... Actually, I don't know if I can eat them, I'm just too lazy to spit them out) and so on. Xiamen people are warm and friendly",Postive
4,4,"This winter, I passed by Xiamen’s trees and flowers, thousands of lights, and the ever-changing wind. Xiamen is a city with romance and refinement at its core. When you come here, you will be unconsciously infected by the environment, with a touch of tenderness, a touch of leisure, and a touch of indifference. <br> With this feeling in mind, I embarked on the first day of my journey to find a dreamy town called Yunshuiyao. Under the blue clouds and autumn water, you can take a leisurely walk among the ancient roads and old streets. You don’t have to look for the scenery deliberately. Every plant and tree here has its own charm. I really like one of the earth buildings called Huaiyuan Building. It has a distant mind and aspiration for the world. It is so heroic. Its structure is very similar to the earth building in a movie I watched, ""Big Fish and Begonia"", which awakened my memories. The intersection of the two feelings made me deeply touched by its simple and vicissitudes of beauty. <br> If Xiamen is compared to an article describing romance and beauty, then Gulangyu Island is the highlight. Gulangyu Island is one of my favorite islands. You don’t have to worry about the time or where you are ahead. Just walk slowly along the alley. You will encounter new surprises at every corner. The trees hear the wind and the ocean holds the blue sky. Color, the night is wrapped around the stars. Gulangyu is a girl who is shy of her beauty. Her every move and smile are amazing, and this girl also has superb cooking skills. As a senior food lover, I walked around Gulangyu Island and vowed to taste the snacks from all over the world. Unfortunately, my stomach capacity is limited, but the deliciousness of the snacks here really impressed me. Fortunately, it rained lightly the night we stayed at Gulangyu Island. The next morning, we walked on the green bricks soaked by the drizzle and rushed to the pier. The air was a little moist and filled with the fragrance of trees and flowers. The fog enveloped the city like a mirage. I felt that everything my body perceived was so poetic and dreamy, refreshing. <br> Xiamen University is one of the most beautiful universities in China. The scenery is indeed beautiful, but I prefer the Furong Tunnel, which is full of creative graffiti by Xiamen University students. Youth is like these ink should be swayed freely to create beauty. . The food in Zengcuo'an and Zhongshan Street is also amazing. Each small shop has its own special flavor. Some merchants' huts are filled with ""time"". The ""time"" here refers to postcards indicating that today's self writes yesterday. The story you tell your future self is very stylish. <br> During my free time, I visited many places, and my favorite was definitely the Railway Park. The green trees and blooming flowers beside the long railway tracks make it a must-visit place for literary and artistic young people. Most of the people walking in the railway park are local elderly people. Grandpa is holding grandma, and grandma is holding grandpa. They have been together for a lifetime. The ordinary beauty is the most touching. <br> Of course, we cannot have fun without the tour guide’s dedicated service. Director Yunshuiyao Lu is a tour guide with rich experience. She explained the characteristics of the scenic spots to us with gorgeous words, which made us fascinated. The tour guide Xiao Su from Gulangyu Island is a very down-to-earth tour guide, humorous, responsible, meticulous and considerate. His sincerity moved everyone, and he is the most caring tour guide I have encountered so far. Hello Xiamen, goodbye.",Postive

We didn’t find out until after we finished eating. It’s not a time-honored restaurant, but you must bring cash with you on the island. Some snacks and delicacies only accept cash. You can go shopping until you return by boat at around six o’clock in the evening. On the fourth day, we mainly visited Xiamen University and Zengcuo'an.

I don’t have much time to visit the Tulou, and I spend most of my time on the road. <br>On the second day of Gulangyu Island, we first went to Baicheng Beach. We walked on the beach and blew in the sea breeze. It was good and the children liked it very much. The sea water in Xiamen has become much cleaner in recent years. We went to the island at 11 o'clock and went to the snack street. The old house tea noodles introduced by the tour guide Xiao Guo were very delicious. Unfortunately, we didn't have the stomach to taste all the delicacies on the island. We walked around, walked down and went back to the hotel. . <br>On the third day, Zengcuo’an, Xiamen University, Nanputuo. The most relaxing day among the three days, the sun was quite bright, but I was in a good mood. <br>Special thanks to tour guide Guo Jiangxia for her meticulous arrangements. She always spoke with a smile. It was very hard on a hot day. Thank you very much.",Postive

I also have a lot of time for free travel, basically at night, because the hotel is really convenient. The Yazhuang side is the center of Xiamen. There is Lotus Park Fried Crab nearby. Ask the people at the hotel and they will introduce it to you. The Yunshuiyao side is also very beautiful. You can buy a Pien Tze Huang and take it back with you. I went to the She people to buy silver jewelry. The pineapples are delicious and very sweet, as well as the red bananas. You can try to bring some of the pancakes back (I think the coconut flavor is delicious), because you won’t be able to buy them when you come back. There is a beach on Gulangyu Island. It is recommended to go in the afternoon, as it is too sunny in the morning, so go buy a seal book elsewhere in advance. There are stamps that can be stamped when you go there. It is recommended to take it with you on your trip from Gulangyu Island, because you can stamp everything, leaving a beautiful souvenir. Zhongshan Road is free to travel , it’s beautiful at night, you can go buy some food and come back, basically you can spend 3 days shopping, because you spend 2 days on the way home, or on the way to Xiamen",Postive

After arriving in Xiamen, someone would send them directly to the hotel, which was very convenient. I chose to travel independently on the first day The botanical garden is very close to the hotel. The hotel is in a good location and very close to the attractions! And there’s no need to change the entire process! Went to Yunshuiyao the next day and enjoyed the beautiful scenery all the way without any expense! On the third day, you can shop and eat at various Internet celebrity shops in Gulangyu Island. On the fourth day, Zengcuo'an, Nanputuo, and Xiamen University are all worth visiting. On the fifth day, you upgraded to a sailboat! Highly recommended, it’s really fun! I had a lot of fun over the past few days😊! It is especially suitable for traveling with children. However, Xiamen’s ultraviolet rays are relatively strong, so you should pay attention to sun protection! It’s best to bring a portable fan with you wherever you go so it doesn’t get too hot!",Postive

The service of Tongcheng in the initial order and payment is very good, and the text message and phone call schedule and service matters are in place. I look forward to the journey starting. Arriving at Xiamen Airport, We were picked up in time and stayed at Runxianglong Hotel. The next day, tour guide Xiao Huang took us to Tulou Yunshuiyao. Tour guide Huang was very considerate and enthusiastic in his service and explanation along the way. Although the weather was very hot, everyone was very happy. We returned to the hotel in the evening I slept soundly after being tired. In the next few days, we were led by tour guide Zheng Luyan, who may have less experience than tour guide Xiao Huang. On the day we went to Gulangyu Island, we took our luggage and other items on the bus and asked the tour guide because the luggage was very heavy. It was very inconvenient to go up to Gulangyu Island and we had to bring it back tomorrow, so in the end we had to take it with us. However, the tour guide Xiaolu was still very responsible. After disembarking, we hired a trolley to deliver our luggage and belongings to the hotel in advance. When we came back the next day, we stayed in the same place. In fact, we can store our luggage at the hotel. The tour guide Xiaolu has also been working very hard these days and his voice has become hoarse. The service is still very good. We have a 6.30 early flight on our return trip, so we arrive at the airport two hours in advance to pick us up. The chef told us via text message that he would pick us up at 4 o'clock in the morning. We were planning to pack breakfast at 4 o'clock. However, the hotel did not agree and could only start packing at 4.20. After communicating with the tour guide Xiaolu, the pick-up driver postponed picking us up for half an hour. Although the time was a bit tight, we still managed to pick us up. The journey was smooth. I hope that the service on the same journey can be more detailed, and that the itinerary consultant can keep abreast of the communication of the itinerary and services, and be considerate, follow-up, and have full control of the whole process.

With the warm and thoughtful service of Tongcheng’s customer service and tour guides, we successfully completed the entire trip in a blink of an eye. It felt great. In particular, our travel consultant Xu Huaru actively helped and provided enthusiastic services before and after the trip and during the trip. When the accommodation was affected by ktw noise on the first day of arrival and my sleep was affected, and the problem was reported to the local hotel and ** and could not be solved, we worked together with Tongcheng. It was said that it would be solved immediately, which made people feel caring. I am also very satisfied with the travel itinerary, transportation pick-up and drop-off, and tour guide service. The hotel is clean and spacious. The local tour guides Xiaozhuang and Li are serious and responsible in their work. Their explanations are funny and enthusiastic, which made the road a bit tiring due to the rolling hills. Xiamen has a pleasant climate, beautiful scenery, and tempting food. Whether you are strolling along Zhongshan Road to trace the old Xiamen, falling in love with the ""Garden on the Sea"" Gulangyu Island to admire the architecture from all over the world, or being intoxicated by the world heritage of Fujian earth buildings and villages.

Although there were some hiccups when checking into the hotel on the first day (make sure to note whether it is a standard room or a double room when booking a hotel), in the end, many parties coordinated to upgrade me to a parent-child room. This was the most comfortable part of the journey. The breakfast is very rich, and there are many snack and seafood restaurants on the road back to Zhongshan in the evening, which is great! If you want better value for money and fresher seafood, it is recommended to go to ""Little Glasses"" or Mingfa Plaza. It is very convenient to go there by bus or subway. On the first day, we went to Hulishan Fort and Gulangyu Island according to the itinerary. Director Zheng patiently explained and took our family of three, followed us all the way until we returned to Zhongshan Road👍, and also gave us guidance on the next trip. The next day, I went to Xiamen University. It was very convenient to take the bus. If you can find a local college student to do an in-depth tour, you can also go there. Playing by yourself is also unique and relaxing. After leaving Baicheng Gate and going to Baicheng Beach, the children had a great time. Then we went to Zengcuo'an, two bus stops away, and then bus B3 all the way to the Botanical Garden, Zhongshan Park and Bailuzhou Park, all worth seeing. When I had time, I went to see a performance ""The Charm of Southern Fujian"" in the evening to learn about the culture of southern Fujian. It was really good to watch! On the third day, I went to Yunshuiyao. It is also very convenient to take a local group tour for a day trip. On the last day, you can choose to travel around the island, visit the Science and Technology Museum, or go for a walk on the beach (if you have enough time, you can go to Jimei Village)~ In short, this trip is super comfortable and enjoyable.

Whether it is arranging accommodation or retrieving the power bank, several tour guides explain in detail, work tirelessly, be patient and meticulous, and arrange the time just right. I went to Tulou one day, and the itinerary was arranged for a whole day. The food was very tasty, very filling, and the rice was very soft, like the rice eaten in the north. I can arrange my own meals these days and eat local specialties, which is great. It is simply a paradise for foodies. I went to Gulangyu Island the next day. The petty bourgeoisie life attracted people's attention. The only bad thing was that the hotel for ground pick-up was not found and was arranged separately. I also bought a lot of specialties. It was very affordable and there was no compulsory shopping. , the seafood is fresh and affordable, and cycling around the island is really addicting. If you have the opportunity, you will come to enjoy the life here and feel the romantic atmosphere. The pick-up and drop-off master is also very considerate and the time is very good.

39,39,"Traveling with five people, we booked the itinerary half a month in advance. The customer service attitude was very good and they confirmed it over and over again. Fortunately, the extra bed fee was not charged for the five people, so the price was relatively cheap. I got off the plane happily on the first day. The pick-up guy was already waiting for me. I checked into Yunhe Hotel smoothly. There was no hot air in the room. It was rainy and cloudy in Xiamen for a few days, so the room was a little cold. But Xiamen is a city without heat and air conditioning, so there is nothing we can do about it. I arrived early and checked the navigation to go to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. The bus was easy to find. There were quite a lot of food in the pedestrian street and there were many souvenirs. I was full after trying the food, haha. Get up early the next day and go to Yunshuiyao and Tulou. The scenery is very good. The journey is a bit long, so I won’t comment on the group meal. On the third day of Gulangyu Island, the weather was good and I was in a better mood. There were snacks all over the street, shops where you can go shopping, and an island where professional photos are taken. There were signs with writing on the shop entrances, so you could have a good time. The accommodation finally has hot air. The inn is very nice, not big, and very cozy. The breakfast is also made by the owner, with delicious brown sugar buns and side dishes. On the fourth day, I went to Nanputuo and Xiamen University. It’s a really good school for dating. It has beautiful scenery, complete facilities, and a lake. It looks like a rich man. On the fifth day, I had free time. I went to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street for a day of shopping.

40,40,"Overall, a good time! On the first day we went to Yunshuiyao, led by Director Liao, it was very humorous! The journey was quite long, so I wandered around and voluntarily bought a lot of coffee, snacks and so on. When I arrived at the scenic spot, I went to pick up the tour guide for tea at his home and bought a lot of tea. Of course, it was also voluntary. I have a soft ear and I am not very good at refusing. I really shouldn’t go out that often, but the tea is good, so I wanted to buy it because the stuff is good! The next day on Gulangyu Island, I just went shopping and eating. I didn’t know which one was delicious. Tour guide Lin Weiming gave me a recommendation. The tour guide will recommend it. Find a tour guide and ask the tour guide. The tour guide will tell you everything, because most things are expensive and unhealthy. That’s the key point. My husband just ate it and felt sick to his stomach! On the third day, I was guided by Qinqin, who was also pretty good. The tour guides for the three days were very enthusiastic and responsible. I was worried before that what if I met that kind of tour guide and it would affect my mood? Then my worries are unnecessary! The place I stayed at was Runxianglong, which was okay, but I felt that the bath towels and towels had not been changed. I slept on a round bed on the first and second days, and the sheets felt like they had not been changed. After the next two nights, I stayed in an ordinary room, and the bedding and towels were changed. I don’t know if the bath towel is just like that or something, but I feel like it hasn’t been changed. The breakfast is not good. There is also a rule that each person can only take one egg. Although I don’t eat eggs, this rule is a bit uncomfortable😭! I lived well in Gulangyu, with a small balcony, and the mattress and pillows seemed to be made of latex. I was very happy. I had read reviews before and said that Gulangyu would be an average place to live, so I didn’t have any hopes. But after I stayed, I was pleasantly surprised! The hotel I stayed at in Gulangyu Island said it included breakfast, but sometimes I couldn't find anyone anywhere, let alone breakfast. I went to the pier and bought three small steamed buns for 5 yuan, a cup of soy milk for 5 yuan, and a lotus root starch bun. Five yuan. My husband ordered a hand cake for fifteen yuan. It was expensive and not delicious. I don’t know if the meal money will be refunded because it said it included meals and there was a third day of riding, but they didn’t let us. Riding, can we retreat together? ! The fruits there are okay, mangoes are a few bucks cheaper than here, and pineapples are too sweet. I feel like they have been soaked in sugar water.

I need to complain about this, because it was 3 o'clock when we gathered back to the hotel, and there were no other itineraries. In this case, the tour guide should arrange the tour time according to the situation at that time, two It took half an hour to eat and play in a hurry, and we were not eating at home.

However, it was 0 degrees on the first day in Xiamen. The air-conditioning in the hotel was not turned on. In addition, the room had no outside windows, so I almost didn't suffer from heatstroke. I contacted the front desk and found a hotel with outside windows that was slightly better. The hotel customer service replied that Xiamen was not open yet. The air conditioning was on, so there was nothing they could do. The group members who traveled with the group the next day stayed at the Sheraton, and the air-conditioning was turned on.

On the first day, I arrived early after changing the plane and went to Zhongshan Road after resting. There were not many people on Zhongshan Road. I found two shops to eat snacks. I queued up to buy them. They were delicious.

I went to Xiamen University on the third day. As for Nan Putuo, I suggest you go to Nan Putuo first and then go to Xiamen University. You can have a meal in Xiamen University and then go to the beach, which is closer... But it may take a long time to go to Xiamen University. We don't have to queue at Xiamen University, which we went to after eight o'clock. When we came out, we were very close to Nanputuo... After that, we walked a long way 🏖️ We rented bicycles and rode around the Huandao Road to the National Exhibition Center. Generally speaking, it was more leisurely and not too rushed.",Postive

The beautiful travel consultant Zhang Yuanyuan also was very attentive in sending out various Xiamen travel guides. The weather was not very hot when I went, which was perfect for shopping and eating. There are many kinds of snacks in Xiamen. Still acceptable. The snack bars recommended by the tour guide were both cheap and delicious. During the last two days, Tour Guide Wang was smiling, patient and serious throughout the entire trip. I am from Inner Mongolia and have never seen the sea. It is a pity that the time spent on the beach in the group is relatively small, maybe because I am afraid of accidents. However, after one day with the group, you can go to the beach to stay by yourself, sit on the beach or go barefoot. It feels very pleasant to walk aimlessly on the beach and feel the sea breeze blowing around you. After blowing the sea breeze, you can take the bus back. Riding on the bus in Xiamen feels like you are filming a Hong Kong movie. There are large and small ramps. The driver will drift from time to time. If there are too many people, everyone on the bus will feel that they are far away from the center of the earth. It feels different from the flat and spacious roads in Inner Mongolia. Every place in Xiamen is particularly suitable for taking pictures, and any photo you take feels very artistic. All in all, this trip was very fun and enjoyable~~",Postive

Arriving at Xiamen Airport, we were picked up on time and checked into Runxianglong Hotel which was not bad. The next day, tour guide Xiao Huang took us to Tulou Yunshuiyao. Tour guide Huang’s service and explanation were very considerate and enthusiastic along the way. Although the weather was very hot, everyone was very happy. We returned to the hotel at night and slept soundly. In the next few days, we were led by tour guide Zheng Luyan, who may have less experience than tour guide Xiao Huang. On the same day we went to Gulangyu Island, we took our luggage and other items on the bus and asked the tour guide about our luggage. It was very inconvenient to bring our luggage up to Gulangyu Island because the items were very heavy. We had to bring them back tomorrow, but we finally let them take them with us. However, the tour guide Xiaolu was still very responsible. After we got off the boat, we hired a scooter to deliver our luggage and items to the hotel in advance. We would come back the next day. Finally, we stayed at the original hotel. In fact, we could have stored our luggage there. The tour guide Xiaolu had also worked very hard these days and his voice had become hoarse. The service was still very good. The snacks in Xiamen are really delicious.

However, travel consultant Li Xueyan regretfully told me that accommodation in Gulangyu Island was really hard to come by and I couldn’t upgrade my stay. As a result, on the morning of the third day, tour guide Chen Jiaquan asked me to check out and said I would stay at Gulangyu Island for the night. It was such a surprise and surprise. We stayed in a villa next to Yuyuan Garden and it was great. We took our children to Longtou Road and the beach in the evening. When I used the Tongcheng app to place an order for the first time, I had too many worries, but it turned out that these worries were unnecessary. I would like to commend travel consultant Li Xueyan because she is the first to use Tongcheng. I had so many questions and she was able to answer them patiently and tirelessly. She even made several phone calls to me. Thank you very much! I will continue to use Tongcheng Travel next time! Finally, I would like to commend the beautiful tour guide - Chen Jiaquan. She is serious and responsible in her work, humorous and explains every scenic spot in detail. She also specially made a food guide and sent it to us, telling us about delicious and inexpensive food.

The rooms in the budget hotels are all full of cockroaches. When I returned to the hotel at night, I found cockroaches crawling on the bed and pillows. The local tour guide will introduce Xiamen specialties and souvenirs. Whether to buy them or not is entirely up to personal preference, and consumption is not compulsory. Individual groups are usually groups of about 20 people. After arriving at the scenic spot, the tour guide will arrange free activities and agree on a gathering time and place. However, there are always team members who are not punctual. The longest wait was 40 minutes before everyone gathered.

I chose Hainan Airlines, thinking that there would be no delays, but the fact is that I am afraid I was afraid of being slapped in the face, and it was said that there was a malfunction before the return flight took off.

551,551,"This time I took my mother to travel to Xiamen. After returning to Shanghai, I would like to talk about the feeling of this trip:<br>1) Climate and scenery: It is currently freezing in the north, but Xiamen is as warm as spring and has pleasant scenery. The season is very suitable for the elderly and children to travel. This time we visited Tulou, Yunshuiyao Scenic Area, Huli Mountain Fort, Gulangyu Island, Nanputuo Temple, Xiamen University, Zengcuo'an and other attractions. The attractions and customs here are unique to Xiamen, unlike some ancient towns. The classes are all the same. This feeling cannot be found elsewhere, so it is worth a visit. <br>2) Tourism and shopping environment: Xiamen has many delicacies and specialties, such as ginger duck, handmade pies, and various seafood, etc. You can taste them to your heart's content. **Strictly abide by the zero-shopping commitment during the travel itinerary , There is no waste of tourists’ precious time in taking tourists to shopping spots, there is no compulsory consumption, shopping is completely voluntary, the quality of Xiamen people is also good compared to some places, there is no case of cheating or robbing customers during the trip, and the travel mood is very good good. <br>3) Itinerary: The entire travel itinerary is reasonably arranged, covering more scenic spots and taking into account the affordability of tourists of all ages. The elderly will not feel tired. The tour guide Xiao Su is also very good, humorous and talkative. The introduction of the attractions is very good. <br>4) Cost-effectiveness: Our tour group is a group group signed up by several **. Our group members communicated with each other and found that the cost-effectiveness of Tongcheng is still very high. Among them, some group members are very well-known. We are those who signed up for the tour with ""a certain journey"" (I cannot name them directly, I believe everyone knows). We are enjoying the same itinerary, the same hotel and the same standard room accommodation, the same number of days, and we signed up at a close registration time. The price is several hundred yuan more expensive than ours, but the treatment is the same. <br>Based on the above reasons: I will still choose Tongcheng when traveling in the future. I hope that Tongcheng can continue to work hard and gain recognition from more tourists.",Postive
552,552,"This 5 days and 4 nights trip to Xiamen, I was still reluctant to leave when I came back on the last day. I really wanted to live there. The weather was so warm and I didn't feel cold at night.<br><br> I arrived at the airport early on the first day. When the flight time was approaching, I heard the horn sound of delayed flight. I felt a little heartbroken, but it was only delayed<br><br>After more than half an hour, I got on the plane. When I arrived in Xiamen, the city I had long dreamed of, I received a call from the pick-up person while still on the plane at the airport. Soon<br><br>a car came to pick me up and take me to the express hotel where I stayed. The hotel was in the city. The transportation is very convenient. The room is a little small, but it is enough for one person. The room is cleaned every day<br><br>Every time I come back, I will see how neat and clean it was when I first came in. The next day we went to the famous Gulangyu Island. There are no buses or taxis on it. We basically have to walk the whole way. Our tour guide Chen Jinyue was very enthusiastic and helped us explain various things along the way. The origins of the landscapes and buildings<br><br>History, etc. When we were tired from walking, they would ask me to sit down and take a rest. The weather was quite hot that day and I was sweating while walking. They also took us to the seaside later< br><br>The beach, although it is just a small beach, but looking at the blue water, my mood is surging, and the sea breeze is blowing, it is really a kind of indescribable comfort, although the schedule is quite tight<br><br> Yes, but it’s worth it, just that my legs will be a little sore when we go back. The next day I went on a self-guided tour. Last night I decided to try the dream paradise in Guanyin Mountain. The transportation in Xiamen is very convenient. It only costs 2 yuan to change two cars. It feels like a fun place. The project is similar to other amusement parks. The only difference<br><br>is that you can see the sea here, because the park is right on the seaside. There are fewer people when you go there, but it is also very good to not have to queue up. The project can be played repeatedly. <br> br><br>The time for the roller coaster ride was a bit short and it ended too quickly. Several items were under maintenance and could not be played, which was a pity. I originally wanted to try the first bungee jump in Xiamen<br><br> , but it costs 130 per person, which is a bit expensive. I couldn’t bear to go and had to give up playing. It’s a little regretful! On the third day, I wanted to relax and unwind, so I went to watch a movie at SM Life Plaza<br><br>. I only needed to take a bus to get there. The square was very big, with phases 1 and 2 connected by a closed overpass. It's convenient. There are a lot of shops here<br><br>and the food is also dazzling. I don't know how to decide. Finally, I went to the specialty store and bought a lot of specialties, and then headed back home reluctantly. <br><br>Early on the fifth day, I made an agreement with Master Chen who picked me up at the airport. Master Chen was very enthusiastic and would get off the car to help pick up the food when we arrived. He was very considerate. I felt very <br><br>satisfied during this trip. The service provided by Tongcheng was very good and I couldn’t fault it at all. The customer service also explained enthusiastically without any impatience. If you need me to give a score<br><br>, I would give it 101 points. One more point is perfect!",Postive
553,553,"When I encountered a situation when booking tickets, I said I had a price issue that I needed to ask about, but no matter how many calls I made, it was not resolved. I am still speechless about Tongcheng. Let’s start with the travel situation. The journey from home to Xiamen went smoothly on the first day. In the afternoon, we went to Zhongshan Road and ate a lot of snacks. Feeling super good. The octopus balls on Zhongshan Road are particularly delicious. It’s the best I’ve ever eaten in many places. There are so many more delicious ones. The next day at Yunshuiyao, we officially met with Minister Wang. He took us to Yunshuiyao. I have to say that the service was super good. He told us what we could and could not buy, and he was very considerate. I want to say here that the Yunhe Hotel where we stayed did not give us water. We bought the mineral water ourselves for the first two days. We didn’t ask for it because we didn’t know it. On the third day at Gulangyu Island, Minister Wang also worked very hard. He took us back and then took a large force back. It was really hard. On the fourth day, we went to Nanputuo Temple and Xiamen University. The travel time of Xiamen University was a bit short, but we really felt a kind of faith at Nanputuo Temple. The other tour guides in the group just talked about it briefly, and Minister Wang was particularly detailed. He explained this belief to us. On the last day, we had free time and went to the street running mentioned by Minister Wang. Since we took the wrong route, Minister Wang sent me a map again, which was very attentive. And that Xiaoqiang, his service is also super good. If you have any questions, you can ask them at any time and answer them at any time. Whether you are going to Gulangyu Island, shopping or buying things, whenever you have questions, he is always there. I don’t worry about not being able to find my motherland when I know you. My consultant Chen Chao in the same city is also very good at providing services. You can always contact him if you have any questions. Ha ha. Hope you guys have good luck with your work.",Postive

The explanations of the scenic spots were very detailed and the suggestions given to us were also very practical. The itinerary of the entire trip is very reasonable.

561,561,"This is the first time for a group tour in Xiamen with Tongcheng. First of all, the itinerary is quite reasonable. The flight to Xiamen in the afternoon of the first day was very convenient with someone who was responsible for picking up the airport. The one-way trip to Yunshuiyao on the second day was The 4-hour drive was quite tiring. Then, on the third day, I went to Hulishan Fort and took a ferry to the pier to Gulangyu Island. After lunch, the tour guide took me around the island and arranged to stay on the island. The conditions were average, but still affordable. Yes, I tasted delicious food on the island in the evening. I was very happy. I got up early on the fourth day and took a boat back to Xiamen. After meeting with the tour guide, I went to Nanputuo. Unfortunately, I couldn’t enter Xiamen University. After that, I went to Zengcuo’an to eat delicious food and finally went to Jimei School Village. After returning to the hotel, we were able to make our own arrangements for the last two days. We went to the beach, the Science and Technology Museum, Bailuzhou Park, and finally arranged to be sent back to Nanjing. Overall, this trip was good, but one sad thing was that the plane was delayed. After arriving in Nanjing, I didn't catch the train home, and I had no choice but to take a taxi home! As for the tour guide’s service, I would say it’s okay, and I’m basically satisfied!",Postive

I think this group tour on the same trip is better. I will join a group in the early stage and then have another day of free travel. It is really inconvenient to go to Tulou Yunshuiyao by yourself. You can go directly to the scenic spots with a group tour and there are explanations for many provinces and cities. One of the nights we stayed in Gulangyu Island. The weather was very hot during the day, but it was very cool at night by the seaside. It was very comfortable to walk on the sea with bare feet and enjoy the sea breeze. The Longdu Hotel we stayed in was a bit far from Xiamen University and Baicheng Beach, but it was very close to SM Shopping Center, which was convenient for shopping. The hotel environment is pretty good. You can wash clothes or dry them in the hotel room. The tour guide we took with the group this time was very good. The tour guide Chen who went to Gulangyu Island was very awesome, very humorous, and the explanations were also in place and very professional. Thumbs up. <br>I completely fell in love with seafood during this trip. The seafood on Zhongshan Road is cheap, good quality and really delicious. Local fruits are also relatively fresh and sweet. In addition, when going to Xiamen, you must wear enough sun protection and bring an umbrella. Also be prepared for delays on your round trip flight. <br>Tongcheng Travel has done a good job.

563,563,"Overall it was good, but the service of the male tour guide on the first day when I went to Tulou was not very good. He always dumped people and was miserable. No wonder an aunt from the same team criticized him in public for ditching the group. On the day of Tulou and Yunshuiyao, tourists were looking for and chasing tour guides all day long. In the next few days, a female tour guide led the tour. The attitude and level of service are quite good, the organizational skills are also good, and the introduction of attractions is quite detailed. The two of them have one thing in common - they stay at tourist attractions for a short time, and when eating and shopping, they stay too long, and the places where they spend money are very expensive. Take one of them for example! When eating at a restaurant recommended by the tour guide on Gulangyu Island, I ordered a local delicacy, ginger duck, for 38 yuan. There were only two or three pieces of meat and a few bones in it, which was not enough to go with the meal. The breakfast at Rendezvous Hotel is very good, but one drawback is that there is no place to dry clothes, and in the end you have to find a way by yourself.",Postive

I just want to say thank you, thank you to Tongcheng Travel and Tourism staff, thank you to the staff and tour guides in Xiamen. When there was no departure, Tongcheng Travel staff promptly informed me of the departure time and precautions. After arriving in Xiamen, the staff promptly picked us up and sent us to the Yunhe Hotel in the city center. The tour guide who went to Tulou on the first day, Su, contacted us in advance to inform us of the itinerary for the next day. Su was super handsome and very enthusiastic. The tour guide for Gulangyu Island, Huli Mountain Fort, Xiamen University, and Putuo Temple was another Director Su. He was humorous and hospitable. He interacted with us along the way and explained the joyful things. We don’t have Zeng Cuo’an and Jimei. But he didn't leave any regrets for us. He went out of his way to take us to Zengcuo'an and Jimei. And take guests to the airport. Director Su takes our safety very seriously. Always remind us to pay attention to safety, remind the bus driver to pay attention to safety. We stayed in Gulangyu Island for one night and got to know Gulangyu Island deeply. Director Su kept reminding us to pay attention to safety when going to the beach. I just want to say a special thank you to the staff of Tongcheng Travel. Thank you to the service staff in Xiamen.

565,565,"This is my first time booking a trip product and I am basically satisfied with it. <br><br>Let’s talk about the worst aspect first: the attitude of the airport shuttle driver needs to be improved! Sharing a car with other guests and being a little earlier or later was understandable, but the driver was impatient and would not take the initiative to contact the guests if there was any situation. He ignored us when we called to ask questions. The customer service attitude of Tongcheng was very good, and the tour guide was also OK. <br><br>The itinerary is scientifically arranged and there is plenty of time for free travel. The hotel is in the city center and the hotel breakfast is also good. Everything you need to play is available, and it doesn’t matter if it’s a little more expensive. However, I feel that the so-called Tongcheng self-operated tours are also for individual tourists. When going to Tulou and Gulangyu Island, there are super large groups of 50.60 people. The tour guide cannot take care of them and is noisy, so the time spent with the group is not very good. <br><br>Score 80 points overall. It is hoped that the service quality of local transportation agencies in the supply chain will be strictly controlled, otherwise Tongcheng's self-operation will not have great advantages.",Postive

The double bed room I stayed in for the second two nights of the trip did not have it. In addition, the tour guides are pretty good, but we couldn't keep up with the pace with our children in tow. Tulou and Gulangyu Island have to walk for a long time, which is too much. A round-the-island road ride and a Jimei appearance tour were given as a gift. In Gulangyu, the tour guide took us to Xinsihai for a rest. There was no compulsory shopping, but many people bought things. In fact, they are sold everywhere in Xiamen.

The itinerary was adjusted. The tour guide is more serious but obviously inexperienced. The paid attractions to be visited in the adjusted itinerary are not notified in advance so that everyone can prepare in advance. For example, there are discounts for booking tickets in advance on the same journey. <br>Super 8 has an average experience. There is not even a bottle of water in the room.

There are also many paid attractions on the island. You can consider going by yourself. I recommend Sunlight Rock... On the third day in Xiamen, the Huanhai Road is beautiful, and the vegetarian cakes in Nanputuo are delicious. , it is worth recommending. There is a long queue to enter Xiamen University. The Furong Tunnel is very long. I went back early in the afternoon, so I can take a stroll... It is easier to travel independently.

The room our companions stayed in actually had a balcony, and you could pull it with a rope. , no matter how many clothes you have, it will be done. Its route arrangements are also relatively reasonable. For example, we took a fancy to its Gulangyu Island accommodation for one night, which is something that many routes do not have. The rooms are expensive, and of course the food is also expensive, but this has nothing to do with Tongcheng. The service attitude of the tour guides is also very good. They are the tour guides with the best attitudes we have encountered, such as Zhang Jiaotuo in the front and Feng Taotao in the back. I give them all 5 points.

Although we also stopped at shopping places to rest along the way, we did not force consumption. On the first day, we went to Tulou and Yunshuiyao. I felt that the scenery there was very beautiful, and the Hakka people were really warm and friendly. Politely, I went to the long-awaited Gulangyu Island the next day and stayed one night on the island. I felt a different petty bourgeoisie life on Gulangyu Island. The pace of life there is very slow and everything feels orderly. It is really suitable for vacation. , if you have time, you can stay a few more nights and have a good feel for the life there. There are too many tourists coming to Gulangyu now, and there are people everywhere. Also, it’s really hot in Xiamen this season. I sweat profusely every day and go to the sauna every day.

Even when our plane was delayed, she helped me contact the pick-up person, which made me feel warm. Big thumbs up👍👍👍👍. The tour guide to Xiamen was also very good. He had a cute name called Wu Duanhong. We even laughed at him. You become red for no reason. 😊😊😊😊Although his Mandarin is not very standard, he brought us a lot of joy along the way, and he also told us what we can buy and what we must not buy. And the return journey was also very pleasant. The tour guide would always ask us where we were and if we had any questions. It wasn’t until I got home that he said he was relieved and felt like a family member, giving him many, many likes 👏👏👏👏. However, the contrast between the accommodation in the urban area and the accommodation in the city is very big. I think the first two nights were the worst in the itinerary, and the stay in Gulangyu Island after I returned to the city was probably the best. This needs to be improved. Fortunately, The tour guide helped me change hotels. I highly recommend staying one night on Gulangyu Island if possible. It is very romantic and very bourgeois.

Hotel accommodation on Xiamen Island is in Longdu Hotel, which is very convenient for shopping and traveling in the city. The family hotel on Gulangyu Island feels very warm and slightly warm, and the owner is very enthusiastic. Master Zhang who picked up and dropped off at the airport was also very nice. On the first day, Zhang Jiaotuo, the tour guide of Yunshuiyao, was funny when he introduced his name but left a deep impression on us. We sang along with him while singing Minnan songs in the car. The introduction was very patient. On the way back, he recommended Wu Zaitian snacks, which are popular among the locals, for the authentic sand tea noodles, shrimp soup, taro buns and roasted pork rice dumplings. I went there again with my mother the night before I came back. On the second and third days, our tour guide was Zheng Mingkun. His accent should be that of a local. He was very patient and explained in detail, and he was also eager to help us solve our problems. Zeng Cuo went alone to eat various snacks.

The tour guide Dai Liumei is very nice and gave us coupons to exchange for fish balls, although we were too tired to eat in the end. During the two days of free travel, you can go around on your own. Didi drivers in Xiamen are very enthusiastic, maybe local people are more enthusiastic, and will tell you where to go and have fun. It is recommended that those who want to go to the beach can go out from Nanputuo and cross Xiamen University. There is a beach named after the gate.",Postive

Gulangyu Island, Hulishan Fort, Xiamen University, Nanputuo, Zengcuo'an, and Zhongshan Road are all in sight. <br> First, let’s talk about the airport pick-up: I arrived at around 0 a.m., and there were already people waiting. The 6-7-seater car will be taken to the hotel as soon as it is full. The airport drop-off will be confirmed via text message in advance and a dedicated vehicle will be used for airport drop-off. <br> Except for the fact that there are many people on Gulangyu Island and the time is a little tight, the rest of the itinerary is relaxing. There are 5 families in the group. There are elderly and children in the group. Director Pan is very good and takes care of them all. The explanation is relaxed and humorous. <br> Thanks to all the staff for giving us a wonderful trip to Xiamen!

The Sheraton Prince Hotel is cheap and delicious, and you can eat there for three days without repeating the same taste. Gulangyu Island is just so so, the Tulou is very good, the scenery on the way to the Tulou is very beautiful, the tour guide Xiao Hu is enthusiastic and thoughtful, making the journey more comfortable. I have to mention the bus driver for the city tour on the first day. He was awesome. The customer came a little late and closed the door and left. The tour guide didn’t wait no matter what.

Although there was a little hiccup before departure, after a few days of playing, I felt that the itinerary was well arranged and the stay was very comfortable. The sea view room in the Wyndham five-star hotel on the last night was even better, and there were many varieties for breakfast, haha! awesome! We checked into the hotel at ten o'clock in the evening on the 3rd. The room was on the road side. We didn't sleep well at night. After talking to the tour guide the next day, he immediately helped us change to a room on the inside! 4 is Yunshuiyao where you can go to the group! The tour guide, Ms. Cheng, was very enthusiastic all the way, and the clouds and rivers were beautiful and elegant! Although it was very hot that day, it was still worth it to see the different scenery! We went to Gulangyu Island on the 5th. Unexpectedly, the company actually sent a special car and a tour guide to receive the five of us. The tour guide Xiao Lin took us all the way by boat, explained the customs of Gulangyu Island, helped the elderly take photos, and introduced the scenic spots very well. detailed! Old people all like this enthusiastic young man! Especially my mother always praises Xiaolin for being patient! On the 6th, we took a special car to visit Nanputuo Temple, Huli Mountain Pao, and Zengcuo'an. The old man believed in Buddhism. At noon, Xiaolin also helped us recommend the vegetarian meal at Nanputuo Temple. The vegetarian meal is really worth trying! In the afternoon, we also gave us a free bike ride around the island road! In the evening, I checked into the Runfeng Jixiang Wyndham Hotel, which was said to be the hotel where national leaders would be entertained at the BRICS meeting in September this year! Five-star hotels are different, the service is in place and the surrounding scenery is beautiful! The breakfast is even more sumptuous! The elderly were very satisfied with this trip!

669,669,"In order to experience the vibrant greenery in the cold northern winter, my daughter and I chose to come to Xiamen. There are unique customs, fishing village culture and Nanyang culture in southern Fujian. The century-old banyan tree in front of the earth building and the banyan trees with connected roots and stems on Gulangyu Island also remind people of the feeling of tracing their roots. Gulangyu Island is an ""architectural expo"". There are many kinds of buildings on the island, including European style, Roman columns, Gothic spiers, Islamic domes, Baroque... Of course, I know so much thanks to Our tour guide Xiao Su. He is a dedicated, funny young man. Through his introduction, we were able to get to know a little bit about Xiamen in such a short period of time. This place is like a book. When you turn page by page while sipping tea, the atmosphere is tranquil and your heart is like a calm lake.",Postive
670,670,"Very satisfied with this trip. It was already past 9 pm when we arrived at Xiamen North Railway Station. The driver's service was very professional, and we arrived at the hotel and checked in very smoothly. I didn't change hotels for the first three nights. The standard room in the south-facing hotel I stayed in was quite comfortable. There was no smell and the air conditioning worked well. The next day, we went on a day trip to Zhangzhou Yunshuiyao. The scenery was infinitely beautiful, with mountains and water. Fruit is quite cheap. A bunch of fresh lychees cost 10 yuan, and the skin is very thin, so they are very delicious. It satisfies our eyes and taste buds. There are also apple bananas, red bananas, dragon fruit, pineapple, and passion fruit that taste particularly good. On the third day, we took a cruise to Gulangyu Island. Looking at Haicang Bridge and Xiamen from the stern of the ship reminded me of San Francisco. Their layouts are somewhat similar, but the difference is that one is Western-style and the other is Chinese-style. There are various styles of buildings on the island that make us overwhelmed, and we have no time to taste all kinds of delicacies. We take fish balls, potatoes, rice noodles, milk tea, and mochi to eat, and we can’t feel how hot Xiamen’s summer is despite the sea breeze. . Shuzhuang Garden is a characteristic garden on the island. It combines Chinese and Western styles and is very beautiful near the mountains and the sea. I also listened to the live performance of Gulangyu Zhibo at the Piano Museum inside. It is not easy for a piano that has been hundreds of years old to be so well preserved. As the sun sets and the lanterns first come on, I look at the statue of Zheng Chenggong in the distance. Thank you that everything has quieted down. Maybe the island will have another beautiful scenery. It was a bit regretful that we could not stay one night and did not have afternoon tea. The tour guide refunded us 20 yuan per person. We thought it would be easy on the fourth day, but the walking data showed 25,000 steps, which included a free walk on Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street in the evening. First I went to the Huli Mountain Fort, and then rode around the island. The former battlefield has now become poetry and distance. I can’t help but feel that happy life now is hard-won and should be cherished. Then we visited Zengcuo'an. I originally thought we could see a real fishing village, but we ended up shopping and eating. Well, we also like this anyway. You won't be disappointed if you come to Xiamen to eat. After eating and drinking, we lined up in a long line to enter Xiamen University. It is said that it is the most beautiful university and a good place for romance. We spent our time on the murals in the tunnel, because it was too long and too many, so we could only skim through them. Finally, we went to Nanputuo Temple and listened to the tour guide's explanation. We learned more about Buddhism, did more good deeds, and cherish the present moment. The tour guides were very dedicated throughout the entire journey and the driver service was also in place. After a good rest at the five-star Sheraton Hotel, we set off for the return trip on the morning of the fifth day. The train journey of more than 8 hours was not too tiring and we arrived home smoothly.

He has been helping me take care of the elderly and control the rhythm at the end. I am really grateful! The location of staying at Times Yaju is very good, and it is very convenient to eat nearby.

The only thing I am not used to is Xiamen’s climate, with large temperature differences and unpredictable weather conditions. When I came, I couldn’t check the weather forecast. It's raining. I didn't expect it to rain as soon as I arrived in Xiamen😂😂. <br>We went to Tulou on the first day of the trip. The schedule in the morning was a bit tight.

Landscapes, I really like the Hakka culture, architecture, and scenery. <br>On the second day of the trip, we came to Gulangyu Island, the most famous scenic spot in Xiamen. I originally thought that Gulangyu Island is a scenic spot famous for its beautiful beaches, beautiful scenery, and delicious seafood, but I didn’t expect that it would be more attractive than these.

682,682,"What a great trip. On the first day, I flew there without any itinerary. I chose a very early flight and was picked up from the hotel as soon as I got off the plane. After arranging accommodation, it was noon. In the afternoon, we walked around Zhongshan Road and ate sand tea noodles, bamboo shoot jelly, fried milk and Ba Popo's roasted grass jelly. I highly recommend the local bamboo shoot jelly and the honey-flavored roasted grass jelly made by Ba Po’s mother-in-law~ Around 7 o’clock that night, a tour guide for the next day contacted me. Although there was a small problem, the itinerary was not the Tulou I wanted to go to, but after communicating with the person in charge of Tongcheng in Xiamen and the travel consultant Zhao Guanglian who always answered my questions, the problem was quickly solved~<br >I went to Yongding Hongkeng Tulou on the second day. I have to say that the group meal was really terrible. There were no Hakka dishes in sight. The steamed egg custard was the most delicious on the table... although it seemed that I was the only one. , did not meet the standard of a small group of 15 people, but after all, when choosing a travel product, what you look for is a quality tour. There were more than 50 people on board this car, and it was indeed not a great travel experience. <br>On the third day, we went to Gulangyu Island, and finally it was a small group, with a total of 12 people. Take a walk around Gulangyu Island and have some snacks. Yip's Mochi is really delicious and not greasy, and here is the Longtou Road Fish Ball, which tastes great. It's just that the afternoon tea time is too short, less than 20 minutes... In fact, it can be longer, because it's only 5 o'clock when we return to the city. <br>On the fourth day, take a walk around Xiamen city. Time is tight for Hulishan Fort, and the Ring Island Road is just a short drive away. There are also various snacks at Zengcuo'an, but here I feel that only Lin's fish balls are pretty good, and the shrimp balls I wanted were ok. I walked around Xiamen University for 2 hours, took a look at the Furong Tunnel, and felt emotional about the university ~ Nanputuo Temple. When I went there, I happened to catch up with the last day of the water and land rituals to send off the gods. The tour guide took a look and said he couldn't enter, so he left. The whole day ended at only 3pm. . . On both days, we gathered at around 9 o'clock in the morning and ended early in the afternoon. I felt that the arrangement was a little unreasonable. It would have been nice to have more time for each attraction. <br>On the fifth day, I have to go home today, but the ticket is scheduled for 4:50 pm. The driver contacted me the night before and said he would pick me up from the hotel around 2:30 and take me to the airport. I had a whole morning to play by myself, so I went to the Botanical Garden and took a ride on the Bell and Drum Ropeway, which ended at the back hill of Nanputuo Temple. So, I went to Nanputuo again. Then, we walked along the Yanwu Bridge and the seaside. We took a look at the scenery on Huandao Road, and then went to Zengcuo'an to eat some snacks. It just happened to be the right time, so we returned to the hotel. The conch skewers might taste better if there were not so many seasonings, otherwise, it would just taste like barbecue 😂<br>By the way, after returning to the hotel on the fourth day, I also went to Cat Street. Well, I can only say that if you love cats, you can go there. Take a look at the museum, there are many cats and many cat accessories. Other than that, it’s really nothing. There, the rice balls and malatang are pretty good, and there’s also a four-fruit soup? ! No matter what it is called, I don’t think it tastes very delicious.",Postive

In terms of itinerary, Director Guo arranged the time just right and gave us suggestions that saved us a lot of time. The only shortcoming is that Tongcheng needs to improve the details, because a small matter made the customer feel uncomfortable.

Except when I checked in at the beginning, the customer service told me that I could check in in advance on the Travel Navigation Zongheng app. When I arrived at Nanjing Lukou Airport, the counter told me that the ticket had already been picked up and asked me to find it. Tour guides are basically on a casual basis. Where can I find a tour guide... Then there is football... More than 90% of the public employees at the counter at Lukou Airport are interns. Newcomers (with a brand on their chest) will never want to come to this airport again. ! Simply! The tour guide is very responsible during the trip. Since the group is breaking up, the tour guide will send a text message one night in advance to notify the details of the time, location, license plate number, and explain it very carefully. The only fly in the ointment was that on Gulangyu Island, due to the weather, it rained, and some families had different itineraries after the group broke up, so the afternoon tea was cancelled. Although the corresponding fee was refunded, it was still a pity. Most activities on Gulangyu Island are carried out according to the tour guide's arrangements.

So friends who want to go to Gulangyu Island on their own must book their ferry tickets in advance. You can just book them online because I didn’t know it at the time. , so I missed it! All in all, this trip to Xiamen was quite pleasant~😊😊",Postive
693,693,"It was a quick trip, so I made the reservation in a hurry. I took a quick look and chose the one that pleased my eyes. The whole trip was pretty good. It was a bit painful to wait for the plane in the middle of the night. I arrived in Xiamen early in the morning. I had no schedule on the first day, so I rested for half a day. In the afternoon, I went to eat at an Internet celebrity restaurant. The special Xiamen snacks here are good. Not far away, the clams are super big and clean, and the sand tea noodles are super delicious. The next day we went to Yunshuiyao and Tulou. I was a bit unhappy in the small group, but in the large group of more than 50 people, there were many children, which made me feel dizzy. The third day was a small group. Fortunately, I was very happy. The tour guide Yuan Shangfu was very good. Before, the tour guides I received sent a message and then disappeared without confirming anything. The tour guide Yuan called the next night to inform them of the itinerary. Yes, very attentive. On the third and fourth days, tour guide Xiao Yuan took us there. We went to Gulangyu Island and had all kinds of food and drinks. There were too many... That's it. Overall, this trip was good. By the way, there happened to be a typhoon on the day I came back, and Xiao Yuan also asked about the situation. In short, he was very considerate and received good reviews.",Postive
694,694,"Xiamen has always been a place that I have always wanted to visit, but my plans every year always fail to keep up with the changes, and every time I fail, this time I finally made it possible. We shopped and ate at Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, visited Nanjing Tulou and Yunshui Yao, appreciated the elegance of architecture from all over the world on Gulangyu Island, paid homage to the famous Nanputuo Temple, looked at Kinmen from the Huli Mountain Fort, lingered in the most beautiful Xiamen University, and performed on the Huandao Road Wetting myself, pulling weeds in the ancient fishing village of Zengcuo'an, Internet celebrities... The overall feeling is not bad, I have visited all the attractions that should be visited, starting from getting off the plane and picking up at Gaoqi Airport, to the arrangement of group tours and transportation in the next few days. In terms of other aspects, the whole process was quite satisfactory, and I especially commend the local tour guide Wu Lihua. The little girl is very enthusiastic and cheerful. She always smiles and explains well. She also jokes with us from time to time. She especially takes good care of the elderly in the group. Because the weather was too hot that day on Gulangyu Island, the old man couldn't bear it, so he asked my dad to wait for us at the meeting point and entrusted Wu Lihua to take care of us. We continued to play on the island. Unexpectedly, the little girl not only took good care of the old man, but also bought ice cream for him to eat. We were very touched. There are also some unsatisfactory aspects in other aspects. The Yunhe Hotel where I stayed a few days ago was not ideal. The air conditioning could not keep up with the cooling on such a hot day. Of course, the Le Meridien Hotel in the end was great. Also, the entire trip was a little rushed, and we only had a quick look at various attractions. Fortunately, after this experience, I can travel freely when I come to Xiamen in the future!",Postive

During the entire group tour, we were all very satisfied with accommodation, breakfast, and pick-up. The one-stop service was in place.

The road is quite close, and Changsha stinky tofu and shrimp cakes are super delicious. The next day we went to Yunshuiyao. The tour guide Zheng Luyan led the tour. He was very responsible. During the long journey, the tour guide’s explanations were very interesting. He showed us cheap and delicious local specialties. He also received calls from previous tourists on the way.

I flew from Changchun to Xiamen on the afternoon of the 21st. Spring Airlines allowed me to try a different kind of air flight... The suitcase is not big, but it cannot be carried in hand. It requires check-in. The 6.9kg fee is 140 yuan. Free meals are not provided on the plane. I bought it. A bottle of mineral water costs 10 yuan, and a fish-flavored shredded pork lunch box costs 40 yuan. I can't bear these... It's my first time... The seats can't be adjusted. I heard they are driven by retired air force... Okay Arrive half an hour early! I will not choose this flight again! What’s worth sharing is Tongcheng Travel’s high-quality services and considerate tour guides and drivers! I received a call as soon as I got off the plane, picked up the plane in time and sent him to the hotel safely. I stayed at the All Seasons Hotel for the first three nights (environmental conditions are directly proportional to the room price), and stayed at the Crowne Plaza Hotel on the last day. I was super satisfied! The trip started on the 22nd. Although it was a long journey to Tulou Yunshuiyao, eight hours round trip (due to the BRICS meeting, some sections of the road were repaired), I saw the real beauty in the movie; I visited Gulangyu Island on the 23rd and listened to the detailed explanation of tour guide Wu Changhui. Feeling the natural scenery of the island; the 24th happened to be the first day of the new year. I went to Nanputuo Temple to burn incense and pray for my family. Then I visited the most beautiful campus - Xiamen University. In the afternoon, I went to Zengcuo'an and met my favorite matcha shop. Finally, Along the way to the Hulishan Fort, I am really grateful to Director Wu Changhui for his attentive and thoughtful service and detailed introduction to the scenic spots. While we learned a lot about local historical stories, we also felt the enthusiasm of Xiamen people. After a few days of companionship, Director Wu picked us up on time and helped us carry our luggage and take photos. It was nothing, and even bought us water and ice cream in the hot weather...

In order to catch the flight, I had to check into a hotel near Hongqiao, Shanghai, one night in advance, and only stayed for three hours. It was thrilling to spend money to take a car to the airport and rush for time. When I came back, I had to fly in the middle of the night✈️, and it was raining heavily in Shanghai, so all flights were cancelled.

The Coastal International Ocean View Room we stayed in was a bit small. The exterior of the hotel is currently being renovated to make it more beautiful in September! By the way, the hotel breakfast is very good. There are razor clams on the first day, prawns on the second day, and chicken drumsticks on the third day. The tour guide for the Tulou tour the next day, He Jinhua, was very considerate, thumbs up! The tour guide at the scenic spot was just so-so. It took a bit long to go to her house to drink tea and promote the tour. It felt like the time at the scenic spot was shortened. On the third and fourth days, we had tour guide Xiao Cai, a cute big boy. I was originally worried that I wouldn’t have time to visit the scenic spots on the last day, but under his arrangement, we were able to complete all the sightseeing! On the fourth day, I was sent to the airport by Didi’s special car, and the driver drove very smoothly! In terms of the number of people in the group, the small group of six to eight people was very satisfied on the third and fourth days! Tulou is a large group of 36 people, so it is a bit difficult to follow the tour guide and listen to the explanation. Overall, I am still satisfied + happy!

Before departure, I consulted my consultant Zheng Min with many questions, and he answered them one by one. I also consulted many details before boarding the plane. Including things to pay attention to when flying, what to wear for the weather in Xiamen, and the customer service staff on the same trip patiently answered me. Except that the flight time was too late on the first day, so that it was already after 1 o'clock the next day when I arrived at the hotel, and it was not until 2 o'clock. I didn't sleep well, but everything else went smoothly. The next day, beauty Zeng Zhen led us to tour the Tulou, which is a natural heritage and rich cultural heritage. We fully felt the wisdom and wisdom of the famous ancestors. A ballad of clouds and water stretches for eight miles. Banyan trees that are hundreds of years old run through the entire town. There are small bluestone bridges over streams and earthen buildings on both sides of the green hills. The blue sky and white clouds above your head take a closer look at the beautiful scenery. You feel relaxed and happy, as if you are in a scroll. On the third day, the post-95 handsome boy Wang Chang changed. Under the guidance of our guide, we visited the world-famous Gulangyu Island, with its sunny beaches, dragon trees, delicious food and pearls everywhere, the blending of mountains and seas, and the interdependence of cityscapes. It really deserves to be called a ""garden on the sea""; on the third day, our tour guide Wang Huanhua led us to visit Incense. The prosperous Nanputuo Temple and Xiamen University, one of the most beautiful scenery in China, use a poem you once read to describe the beautiful scenery of Xiamen University: <br>The trees on Wulaofeng add greenery, and the tide of Xiamen Bay is noisy day and night. <br><br>The Jiageng Towers tower into the sky, and the water of Furong Lake is as blue as the sky. <br><br>Fragrant grass and trees provide thick shade, and the greenery remains unchanged all year round. <br><br>It is always a pity not to see Taoyuan, but now that I have seen this place, I will no longer miss it. <br> On the fourth day of our free trip, we went to eat delicious food and shop again.

You can eat cocktail shrimp, small conch and small mango as you like. The hotel's service is also very good, and every customer is really treated like God. The next day, we went to the Tulou. The trip was relatively long. The Tulou was very unique, and the tour guide’s introduction was also very vivid and detailed. After Director Lu’s introduction, I also gained a deep understanding of the local customs and customs. The only drawback was that during the lunch at Tulou, the number of dishes was a bit small and not enough to eat. We finished almost every plate and still felt not full. So we decided to go to the gas station to buy some bread, but the gas station ran out of bread, so we bought the last box of biscuits. As for Gulangyu Island, the most interesting thing is Shuzhuang Garden, where the piano is very interesting. In addition, it’s best to time it right. He will play the song Gulangyu Zhibo every once in a while. It will be even more beautiful if you catch it just in time. Sunlight Rock is so-so. In addition, I would like to say that Hulishan Fort and Nanputuo Temple are very interesting. The tickets are not expensive, so you must go and see them. Nanputuo Temple is still free of charge, and it is more magnificent than the temple here where the entrance fee is 89 to 90 yuan. If you go to Xiamen University, you must visit the tunnel.

First of all, I stayed at the Golden Four Seasons Hotel for the first three nights. The hotel was a bit shabby. The toilet roof leaked for a while, and there was no cold water for a while. The breakfast was also very simple. I was not very satisfied with this hotel, but I was very satisfied with the Sheraton for the last night. ! Let's talk about transportation. The airport pick-up and drop-off were all on time, and text messages were sent for confirmation. On the first day, Yun Shuiyao was in a group tour, and it took eight hours of bus ride back and forth, which was very tiring. The second day started with a small group tour, there were only four people in total, so it was relatively relaxed and comfortable. Special mention should be made to the beautiful tour guide Xiaohan, who was very nice, enthusiastic and talkative. She took us on all the fun in the next two days of the trip. She played it all, took us to buy pearl necklaces and helped us negotiate the price. It was so considerate. Thumbs up for her! The driver, Master Chen, was also very nice. He picked us up and dropped us off all the way and was very dedicated! The most dissatisfactory thing was that the flight back and forth was delayed.

As soon as we arrived at the airport, the pick-up man was waiting for us and he was very enthusiastic and sent us off. Hotel, we set off to Yunshuiyao at 7 o'clock the next day. I especially want to praise tour guide Xiao Yang for his patience and care all the way. Because it rained so hard, the driver worked very hard all the way. He drove on the mountain road in the heavy rain and came back. We also encountered a collapse on the mountain on the way. The driver got out of the car in the rain to observe the terrain, and asked us to get out of the car and risk our lives to drive over first, then let us get in the car and continue to drive us back to the hotel safely. I had a great time visiting Tiangulang Island. The handsome director Xiaokang was great. Even though he was young, he was thoughtful in everything.

Moreover, the driver was really bold, and he was really drunk while playing on his mobile phone while driving. <br>The trip to Xiamen was not bad. The itinerary was quite intensive and it might be a bit tiring. The trip to Gulangyu Island required a lot of walking. <br>It is recommended to travel independently in Xiamen. Xiamen is a relatively small city and the attractions are relatively concentrated. They are basically in the same place, so you don’t have to worry about getting lost. <br>Gulangyu Island is also suitable for independent travel.

I personally like Yunshuiyao and Xiamen University’s Lover’s Valley, which are beautiful. I went on a sailboat on the last day, which was quite exciting. Yes, the water is clean and you can see Taiwan. Gulangyu Island, Zhongshan Road, and Zengcuo'an feel overly commercialized. There are a lot of people and there are only a few types of shops. For me, who loves food, I just eat, eat, eat. I have gained a lot of weight. There are abundant fruits. My favorite is pineapple. It's very sweet. <br>The weather was not good in the first two days, with rain, but in the next three days the sky was clear, and my skin was sunburned. It is still early spring, so be sure to wear sunscreen when you go later. The roads in Xiamen's urban area are narrow and traffic jams are serious. Many places are preparing for the BRICS meeting in September. They are repairing and repairing everywhere. Many places are inaccessible, which is a pity. <br>In terms of accommodation, the Golden Four Seasons Hotel where I stayed for the first three days did not have its own catering. The breakfast was KFC every day, which was terrible, but my stay was okay. On the last day, the sea view room in Wentham was very beautiful, and you could see the Mazu statue. There are many sailboats at the Xiangshan Yacht Club opposite, and the service is also very good. They even lent us a hair dryer when our clothes got wet while sailing. <br>The customer service arranged the itinerary very well, and the airport pick-up and drop-off service was also very satisfactory.

The environment where I live is pretty good and the food is pretty good. You get what you pay for. As long as you don't have to spend money to buy a pound of tofu, it's OK to get a pound of meat. Going to Yunshuiyao on the first day was a bit tiring, the ride was too long, but the scenery was nice. It can be described as regretting or not regretting. When we went to Gulangyu Island the next day, it rained, which was a pity, but thinking about it, the rain scene was not bad. On the third day, Xiamen University was a bit disappointing to me. When I came to Xiamen, part of it was for him and part of it was Gulangyu Island. Maybe the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. In fact, it's not bad. I blame him for thinking he is too beautiful. When we stayed at the Sheraton on the fourth night, we were given a standard room. During our honeymoon, they were given a standard room for me, which was a bit incomprehensible. I hope you will pay attention to this next time you book a room for your guests. During the trip, there was a heavyweight who accompanied us all the time. He was baby-fat, naive, nice, good-tempered, and very funny. He explained while walking.

711,711,"Overall, I am quite satisfied with this trip. Fengxingtianxia's airport pick-up service is very considerate. Judging from the itinerary, I went to Yunshuiyao on the first day and Gulangyu Island on the second day. While enjoying afternoon tea, I wandered around the beach and picked up sea shells. I checked in at the Bowen Bear Hotel on the island in the evening. It was a pity that I didn’t go there. It was too late. There were only rooms on the first floor. Breakfast on the island was not available until 8 o'clock. I was going to the fort on the third day, but it was a pity that I didn't get the buffet breakfast. The urban area I went to on the third day felt quite boring. Most of them were free activities. I didn’t go to the temples or anything. I was too tired to walk. However, I took photos of waves in the tunnel of Xiamen University, which was quite satisfying. Ni Bing, the dedicated customer service staff at Tongcheng, was very patient in providing guidance on this trip, and his after-sales service attitude was also good. He is a customer service worthy of everyone’s trust, and even helped me handle my order late at night during non-working hours. The popular tour guide Qinqin is also very responsible for her work. When we were on Gulangyu Island, she explained it very carefully, allowing us to better understand this lost island. Below is a summary of this trip. I am basically satisfied with the service and the accommodation is average and acceptable. If you like a clean place, I recommend you upgrade to a 5-star hotel. The tour time is a little early, and there is no breakfast every day. It may be because there will be traffic jams in Xiamen late. The tourist attractions are relatively free, suitable for tourists who can’t walk, stop and go to see the city Not bad, don’t be in a hurry, the night view is quite beautiful.

713,713,"The plane arrived in Xiamen on the morning of the 17th, and the pick-up service was super good. Someone was there to greet me as soon as we got off the plane. I am very dissatisfied with the group hotel at this price, because if I knew the environment was like this, it would be better to stay in an express hotel elsewhere and save 800 yuan. I stayed at the Coast International Hotel because I am mysophobic and care about where I live. But that hotel is a pseudo-five-star hotel. The room environment is very average and it feels not as fast as fast. But the location is good, next to Zhongshan Road. You can go shopping at any time at night. There are eight cities and other places that are very close. There is the sea across the road. You can stay in the room. You can see the sea, but the breakfast in the hotel is very good. You can have breakfast on the terrace, which feels very good. Just this breakfast and the foreign breakfast terrace are like five stars. At that time, I thought that we would only stay for two days anyway, and since we were part of the group, we couldn't leave, so we had to make do with it. Then I really hoped that the Gulangyu Villa Hotel where we stayed on the last night would be better. Then the tour guide told us to stay at the Pannuo Hotel when we arrived at Gulangyu Island. As a result, it was raining that day and we walked for a long time. When we finally arrived, he told us that ** had forgotten to book a room for us, and then contacted the tour guide. We booked a villa hotel for us. We carried a large bag of luggage and walked in the light rain for 10 minutes to get to the hotel. We were already tired from walking on Gulangyu Island that day, so I was not very happy because the hotel was wasted... and it was worth the trouble. Okay, but it turned out that the hotel was very poor and shabby. It was better to stay in Xiamen and not get a sea view room on Gulangyu Island. The key point is that we are a couple and they booked a room with two beds for us... This is the complaint about the accommodation. The overall trip is still very happy. I really like Xiamen. Children from the Northeast really like the south. It is so beautiful. The street trees are iron trees. I like it very much. I like places with the sea. It’s just that prices in Xiamen are so high. It costs more than 1,000 to eat seafood, and if you don’t eat at a tourist attraction, you shouldn’t be ripped off. I should go back a second time, I like it.",Postive
714,714,"The overall itinerary was quite satisfactory. When I first arrived in Xiamen, I saw a notice at the front desk of the hotel saying that sailings to Gulangyu Island were suspended due to the impact of the typhoon. I felt very disappointed at the time and asked the tour guide. The tour guide calmly said that there should be no problem. Then I arrived at the pier on the third day and waited. I kept waiting and finally waited until the announcement said, ""We are pleased to inform you..."" The hall immediately burst into cheers. The first day of Yunshuiyao was relatively relaxing because it was raining and not exposed to the sun. It was just a walk, a look and a listen, but the journey was quite far. Gulangyu Island is like another Macau. For those who have been to such a small island, there is nothing new. It is not bad to enter the wax museum. It is not small inside and you can play for a while. On the third day, Zengcuo'an was just a snack street, and the environment was average. Xiamen University was also different from what I imagined. There were no distant fields, only the noise of the world. <br>The hotel on the last day was so great that we stayed in a hotel on the last day. It also had a free swimming pool and a rich breakfast. We should stay in a good hotel when we go out in the future!",Postive

716,716,"It is my first time to come to Xiamen. Overall, I feel that this coastal city is very good. It has a cool breeze. This season feels like autumn and it is also very comfortable. I arranged a tulou on the first day of the itinerary. The itinerary is relatively far and there are many people. But the arrangement was more appropriate, and the tour of idyllic scenery was very warm and detailed when I received a text message from the tour guide Qinqin on the day I came back. I visited Gulangyu Island on the second day of the trip. Under the rich explanation of the tour guide Qinqin, I felt the slow pace of Gulangyu Island. The life, profound cultural heritage, and afternoon tea by the seaside are indeed what Qinqin said. Only the popular platform can have such treatment. On the third day, we visited the urban area, the fort, Huandao Road, and rode a bicycle in Zengcuo'an. Beautiful beach, sea, Nanputuo prayer, the beauty of Xiamen University campus ~ relaxed and slow pace, tour guide Qinqin arranged very well, service attitude was also very good, small group, four families, everything was clearly arranged, and Qinqin was very good at it. The elderly people in the group were very patient, took the initiative to help take photos, and gave a big thumbs up. Thank you Fengxing Tianxia for arranging such a good tour guide. We stayed at the five-star hotel Crown Panji for the last night. The terrain is excellent and lively. The tour guide Qinqin also introduced it. I went to many nice places for free activities. Generally speaking, Fengxingtianxia’s platform is still very reliable. It is basically the same as the one in the order itinerary ~ I will continue to choose this platform in the future. When I come to Xiamen, I must look for Qinqin. In addition, when it comes to air tickets, I have to complain to the customer service of the platform. The money was collected when we agreed to change the flight time, but everything was not done well, but the tour guide Qinqin also reassured us and suggested places to travel! Happy trip to Xiamen, thank you~",Postive
717,717,"Xiamen is a very nice place with good air and beautiful scenery. Especially the local snacks are very unique and taste good. I originally thought that northerners would not be used to them, but in fact the taste is very consistent and it is worth a visit ~ We signed up for a small group. Before going, Tongcheng consultant Lu Yao was very patient He introduced us the advantages of each product and took the trouble to help us apply for discounts. He is a great consultant. After arriving in Xiamen, the tour guide Xiaolin had a cheerful personality and took us to every scenic spot. He was a very good tour guide ~ Gulangyu Island, this small island in the sea is so beautiful, with beaches and small streets. It is a very unique place, but the time is too short. It’s a bit regretful. I will definitely stay a few more days next time I go there~ How happy students must be... The most enjoyable part of this trip is riding a bicycle on the road around the island, blowing the sea breeze and looking at the sea view. I am determined to ride a whole day like this😛 Xiamen is a beautiful city. I look forward to next time Meet you (^^)",Postive
718,718,"On the first day of free travel, I went to Zhongshan Road. Personally, I felt that just strolling around Zhongshan Road was enough to get a feel for the old town of Xiamen. It was fun to take photos in the streets. We walked around for a long time that day, and even walked to a seafood market. It was not for tourists, but local residents were shopping to feel the local atmosphere. When you arrive at Gulangyu Island, try Xiamen’s delicacies. It’s cleaner than Zhongshan Road and has more varieties. The next day, Yunshui Yao suggested watching that movie first. You will feel that there are scenes in the movie everywhere, and they are very beautiful. The third day was Gulangyu Island, which is really a small island worth visiting. It is surrounded by the sea and has many attractions. You can buy tickets and go in by yourself, but we are too pressed for time. It would be best if you can stay in Gulangyu Island for two or three days. The third day was at Xiamen University, where my husband and I had the feeling of being a college student. The only shortcoming is that the tour guide's accent is too serious and I really can't understand many words. If you have the opportunity in the future, it would be a very good choice to go to Xiamen for free travel.",Postive
719,719,"It was great to go out this time. I changed the hotel in the middle and it was resolved immediately. The tour guide was also very good. The master called me before I even got off the plane after arriving in Xiamen. When I went back, he texted me the night before to confirm. Every day, the tour guide would confirm the itinerary with us in advance and arrange the time. After arriving at the hotel, the hotel guy would pick us up and help me carry my luggage. He was super nice and the tour guide introduced the scenic spots very well. They took good care of each of us. Among them, we didn't have the scenic spot Jimei Mei Village, but a few people in the same car did, so they took us all there together and told us which things to eat were clean and hygienic, and which things not to buy. There is no compulsory shopping, which is very nice. This is the second time I have traveled to Xiamen. I have booked with Tongcheng. I will still choose Tongcheng when I go out for fun in the future. The customer service staff of Tongcheng, Zhong Yan, is also super good. He helped me answer all my questions and confirmed with me step by step.",Postive
720,720,"Yunshuiyao and Gulangyu are pretty good. The buildings have more local characteristics. One represents Fujian's past and the other reflects Fujian's modern times. Especially the village where Yunshuiyao is located has very good air quality, green mountains and green waters, banyan trees, stone bridges, and green orchards, which makes my heart calm down. Next time, you may consider staying in an original ecological village for two or three days to truly experience the quiet and slow life. Xiamen University and Zeng Xi'an are a bit disappointing. I feel that the various introductions I have seen before are a bit exaggerated. There are countless universities with similar scenery across the country. It takes a lot of effort to turn a university into a tourist attraction. I don’t understand how college students can still study well when they meet so many tourists on the road while studying every day? Zengxi'an is a snack street. The hotel and tour guide uniforms are not bad. Although the itinerary is tight, it is suitable for lazy people like us who don’t want to worry. It is very cost-effective especially during the Chinese New Year.",Postive

Some of the uncomfortable points were that some of the prices negotiated in advance were a bit inconsistent on site, such as the extra bed fee, and the children's expenses, such as breakfast fee. In addition, dedicated tour guides are good at recommending products, while tour guides who cannot recommend products are not dedicated enough. If they communicate well, some of them will be fine. Let me complain, the front desk of Times Yaju had a bad attitude, and the driver's attitude on the second day's trip was very bad.

The earth buildings are worthy of being a world cultural heritage. I admire the wisdom of the working people. On the third day, I traveled to Gulangyu Island to feel the petty bourgeoisie sentiment. We went to Railway Cultural Park and Wanshi Botanical Garden to experience tropical rainforest plants, desert succulents, and cacti. The children had a great time.

I went to Yunshuiyao on the second day, although it took more than 4 hours to get there by bus, but it was worth going. The ancient town is full of gravel roads, and I walked the whole way. The scenery was beautiful, the air was fresh, and for the first time I saw a large banyan tree that was hundreds of years old. Very shocking. And the circular ancient building in ""Big Fish and Begonia"" is very special. We went to Gulangyu Island on the third day. The buildings on the island have a history of hundreds of years. They are all former consulates of various countries. There are Gothic buildings, European buildings, British buildings, etc. The travel arrangements these days have been very pleasant, and there is no rush. Most of the scenic spots are on the island, which is very convenient. Xiamen is really a great place and I will go there again if I have the chance.",Postive

In particular, there is a rich and delicious breakfast, and the dishes in the Chinese restaurant on the second floor are also great. During the three-day trip, the tour guide Jian Bin was conscientious, enthusiastic and thoughtful. She could solve problems in time and got along well with everyone. I liked it. Master Lu, who is responsible for pick-up and drop-off, is very punctual, patient and thoughtful, and very satisfied.

It was quite tiring to follow a large group of fifty or sixty people, but the tour guide that day was pretty good. This trip was overall good. I booked it last minute.

The local tour guides in Xiamen were very enthusiastic and the pick-up at the airport was also on time. The first day was Tulou, the second was Gulangyu Island, and the third day was a local tour of Xiamen. The itinerary was very compact. Although the weather was hot, it took good care of my 75-year-old mother-in-law and children. In terms of accommodation, I spent some money to upgrade to Xiamen Rushi Hotel in the first three days. The room was quite large. Free upgrade to 5-star Le Meridien hotel on the last day. The price of local seafood is also reasonable. The commercial atmosphere of Zhongshan Street and Gulangyu Island are similar. The Sha Cha Noodles are delicious. There are attractions that should be visited, such as Xiamen University. Although the weather is hot and the queues are long, the young tour guide will accompany us throughout the queue. , quite touching. This trip was a graduation commemorative trip for my son before he went to study abroad, and he was deeply impressed by the beautiful landscape of the motherland.

Fish balls, bapopo~ etc. We were very happy the whole time. Our little group gets along very well! Also, we underestimated the sun in Xiamen this time. We checked the weather before leaving and found that it was not that hot. Because I didn’t get sunburned when it was over 40 degrees Celsius in Thailand before, I didn’t wear sunscreen... As a result, my skin was very painful from the sun. Next time I travel, I must be more comprehensive! Finally, life in this small city is slow and it is a good place to relax and retire.

782,782,"Xiamen is a city suitable for leisure and small bourgeoisie. It is full of various customs and has many attractions in the city. Gulangyu Island and Xiamen University are must-see attractions. This trip was booked for my parents. Therefore, if you choose to travel with a group, if you are on your own, you will still choose to travel independently. After all, a place that feels so free and comfortable should be the time to stay and walk around slowly. The transportation between the various attractions is very convenient. The few days my parents went there were mostly cloudy with bursts of light rain. It is a pity that the Ring Island Road, which should be very beautiful, is under comprehensive repair and construction. It is suitable to walk or ride on the Ring Island Road when going to the beach. It is recommended to take the sightseeing bus around Xiamen Island. The total journey is more than 50 kilometers. You can view the beautiful scenery of Binhai Road. Many buildings and landscapes are on this line. It is the best way to quickly understand Xiamen. The bad thing is that during this trip, my mother's birthday should be on Gulangyu Island. It was previously communicated that the hotel would send a birthday fruit plate to fill her with a beautiful mood for her birthday out of town. Although it's not something important, I didn't receive it. It's a bit regretful... The other thing is that on the day we went to Gulangyu Island, we gathered back to the hotel at 16:00. I personally think this should be adjusted appropriately so that everyone can spend more time on the island. After all, there are no arrangements for the evening. Moreover, the time to return to the hotel was a bit awkward. Going to the island was a bit difficult, so I decided not to go. The time for shopping became very tight again.",Postive
783,783,"This trip to Xiamen was generally good, especially the tour guide Cai Yutao, who is known as Fatty Cai. He is a 240-year-old thin man who can talk well. The key point is that everything he does is for the sake of tourists. One suggestion is that whether it is an app or a **, when forming a group, you can divide the group into groups according to age. We are a small group of 12 people. There are few people and it is okay. The Yunshuiyao line on the second day is a local group, so I feel that a group of thirty or forty people is like joining an elderly group. It’s not that the elderly are bad, but there is always some difference in concepts between the elderly and the young. On the first day, there was a special ground pick-up and car pick-up when we got off the plane. The waiting time depended on luck. Because it was a scheduled flight, we waited for 40 minutes. Of course, it was understandable. There was no itinerary that day, so we had free time, so we visited Zhongshan Road during the day and Bay Park at night. The distance is not far from the hotel. I take an express bus when I go there, and ride a small yellow car when I come back. It feels good. After breakfast the next day, we went to Yunshuiyao. Breakfast here should be mentioned. Dinner starts at seven o'clock. Grandparents have been waiting early in the morning. When the door opens, they swarm over the food as if they were filming a movie, and then disperse at the buffet counter. It was already empty. So, go grab it because you are embarrassed, because you won’t be able to eat it due to time constraints. You want to grab it, but you feel like you can’t do it. But there are also many breakfast shops next to the hotel. The next day, Yunshuiyao has beautiful mountains, beautiful water, and good scenery, but it has become more commercialized after it became a tourist area. The first tour guide will take you to his home and sell his real estate tea, which is indeed cheaper than outside, but you have to bargain hard. Starting from the third day, Fatty Cai will lead the team, so you can rest assured and follow along.",Postive

I have met at least dozens of tour guides, but Guide Ma is definitely the most popular one I have ever met. The most impressive and responsible tour guide will not take you to buy anything and tell you how to choose fruits and which ones not to buy (for example, it is best not to eat seafood now that the season has changed). There are also some stores (especially cheap ones) that you should not buy if you have any questions. You can ask him and he is very patient and responsive. We have an 83-year-old grandma, a pregnant woman, and a 2-year-old child in our group. He helped carry things and supported the grandma in pushing the child's car. He also asked us if we were walking too fast. My flight was late and my ticket was booked at the wrong time. He kept calling to help me and asked me to go to the convention center on my own. The driver recommended which island or duty-free city to take us to and said it was very interesting. I called him and he told me that there was no one there. There is nothing special about it. I don’t recommend it. Most of the drivers are there just to make more money and so on. I can’t go into details but I will take it seriously in my heart. So I really like him very much. Thank him. ps.

We solved it one by one. He was a great tour guide. With him as our guide, the whole team had a great time. If I had to find a flaw in this trip, it would probably be the accommodation. The hotel room department arranged for the first three days was a bit cramped, but the breakfast was all OK, so the price/performance ratio was quite high. Overall, this trip to Xiamen was quite satisfactory and it was a good choice for us. 🌹",Postive

The five-star hotel on the last day was great and the breakfast was very rich. The tour guide I went to Yunshuiyao the next day felt good. It's so fierce. When she smiles, she doesn't feel very understanding. It makes people feel scared! (The next day when we went to Yunshuiyao, we were three minutes late because of our children. The tour guide told us: if it takes more than five minutes, we would take a taxi to meet them at another hotel!😥😥😥) Fortunately, we had a different tour guide on the third day, one with the surname Wu.

820,820,"I chose Tongcheng.com as my travel assistant after being recommended by my colleagues. It was my first time to experience the services of this platform and I felt that it was not bad. The driver at the pick-up and drop-off station was punctual and attentive, the tour guide was friendly, and the itinerary basically followed the process in the travel notice. It’s just that it’s too hot to visit Xiamen in July and August, and the sun is also “baking”, which slightly affects your interest in traveling. Everything else is good. I only had a group meal once (the day I arrived in Tulou) and I tasted all the main snacks in Xiamen, which opened my taste buds. I cannot praise the food at Xiamen University. I suggest those who want to go there to lower their requirements in this regard. The beauty of Xiamen University lies in its architecture and humanities. You must go to Gulangyu Sunlight Rock and climb to the top. This time, many people gave up climbing because they were afraid of the heat and sun, which was a pity for them. Infinite scenery is on the dangerous peak. Besides, Sunlight Rock is not high, only 92.7 meters. But standing on the top of the mountain and looking around, the entire Gulangyu Island can be seen. As the saying goes, ""When the sea reaches the end, the sky is the shore, and when I reach the top of the mountain, I am the peak."" The blue sky, The white clouds, blue waves, coconut wind, red tiles, and green trees are so beautiful that it takes your breath away. . . . . . <br>Every time I travel, I always have more to say.

The Buddhist style of the hotel is very good, but the location is far away from the business district. The upgraded Crowne Plaza on the last night was also great. The buffet had many varieties, including salmon and sashimi. The most considerate thing is that the entire trip includes breakfast for children, which is very heartwarming. After arriving at noon on the first day, I contacted the pick-up manager and arrived at the hotel smoothly. In the afternoon, I went to Zhongshan Road for snacks. Yun Shuiyao started his trip early the next day because the journey was indeed quite far. Fortunately, he returned to the hotel at 7 pm. Yunshuiyao Tulou has beautiful scenery but a lot of people. The lunch at noon is very good! The next day we visited two scenic spots, Huli Mountain Fort and Gulangyu Island. Personally, I think the time for Gulangyu Island is a bit too short. It would be better to arrange a separate day tour for Gulangyu Island. On the third day, we traveled around the city, cycled on Huandao Road, Zengcuo'an, Xiamen University, and Nanputuo. The beach on Huandao Road is really beautiful, and the trip to Xiamen University is worthwhile. Zengcuo'an and Zhongshan Road are very similar. It's a pity that the group was organized at 3pm.

1109,1109,"During the typhoon, we ended our trip to Xiamen! <br>The first time I booked a trip on e-commerce, I was really nervous because the holiday came suddenly, so I booked the trip one day before departure. The local ** consultation does not have an itinerary that can be left the next day. Let’s try e-commerce. I would like to express my special thanks to customer service Ma Huijuan (who gave me a lot of help at the beginning and end of the trip). The girl took the trouble to check the route for me. We changed many plans and finally settled on Xiamen. <br>On the first day, we flew to Xiamen in the evening. Master Zhang had already sent me the pick-up phone number before arriving on the same journey, and we arrived at the hotel smoothly. Yuehua Hotel is very close to the airport and has a good environment. I have to say that the hotel recommended by the customer service girl is really good. We are traveling with children. The hotel not only has a children's playground specifically for children, the environment is quiet, and the garden is beautiful. The front desk was very enthusiastic in introducing us to nearby attractions and routes. We immediately decided not to go to the tulou on the itinerary and just wandered around the nearby beach ring road. <br>The next morning, they went to the garden for morning exercises. At 9:40, the hotel's sightseeing bus took us to Baicheng Beach. We rented parasols. We lay on the beach and let the children play in the sand... leisurely , I ate at the seafood stall at the beach at noon. You can order it, but I don’t recommend their set meal. I looked at the one next door and thought it was too average! When eating food stalls in scenic spots, you must be thick-skinned, bargain with the boss and clarify the price before eating. Haha, when the tour guide mentioned this the next day, he said that he wanted to eat clearly and happily. We picked a steamed grouper, which the kids love to eat. Clams, oysters, etc. are not something that a parent-child tour can experience😄! At noon, I took a taxi back to the hotel and took a late nap. In the evening, I took a taxi to Zhongshan Road for a stroll. My children bought a lot of toys... I went back to the hotel to sleep with satisfaction. In the evening, the tour guide made an appointment with me to visit Gulangyu Island on the third day. <br>On the third day, because we had already seen the fort the day before and were unwilling to go to the scenic spots, we still slept until we woke up naturally. We set off at nine o'clock and went to the port to gather with the troops. Only then did we meet the tour guide Xiao Su who had called us many times. Comrade, a particularly funny little yellow flag. There was no one at the pier. Yesterday I heard that it is difficult to buy tickets for Gulangyu Island. When I arrived at the pier, I realized that they had all been bought before ten o'clock😱. If I came by myself, I would have to queue up everywhere to buy tickets... Going to the island is really not big, just like the pedestrian street. They are selling things, haha, buy some small gifts and wander around! The young master asked along the way where there was a beach. Well, let’s go visit the attractions. We went to the beach again! When we returned to the hotel in the evening, we didn’t even have the energy to go to the restaurant. We had to take out... We all had a super happy vacation here. During the meal, the news started to report about Typhoon Catfish... When I looked at the route, I cried, this is it, and I started to give The tour guide’s phone number... gave Tongcheng a call... called China Southern Airlines... various calls were made, but Tongcheng refused because we had a special ticket with no refund or change. <br>Except for the wind being a little stronger in the early morning of the last day, the sun was very good. I also thought the weather forecast was inaccurate! I visited Zengcuo'an with everyone, and when we arrived at Xiamen University and Nanputuo, the situation suddenly changed and it started to rain! All attractions are closed. We arrived at the airport and were informed that the flight was grounded. Stay in a nearby hotel with the help of your tour guide. I am very grateful to the tour guide Xiaosu and customer service Ma Huijuan",Postive
1110,1110,"1. Accommodation and meals: The first of the first two pictures is of a private hotel on the first and third days, called Yujinmen, near Huangcuo on Huandao Road. On the first day, it was almost 7 pm when we arrived due to a delayed flight. Ordered (the flight was delayed four and a half hours, and I sent a text message the night before the trip to inform me. The travel consultant Mengmeng was still helping me contact me at 12 o'clock in the evening to confirm. It was really considerate) and the good rooms were all occupied. , so the room arranged on the first day was very crowded and there was no space for our suitcases. Fortunately, the boss Aaron was very friendly and he agreed to arrange a large room for us when we returned from Gulangyu Island and stay here on the third day, with a balcony. I saw the sea, and it was indeed like this on the third day. In addition, since the trip is far from the main road, Aaron will pick up and drop off by electric car if necessary. I like it. The second picture is of an inn on Gulangyu Island the next day. It’s called Huateng Diaoju. It’s in the back of an alley. The environment is okay. The bed is a big bed with bunk beds, just like in a university. Breakfast at both hotels is relatively simple, and other lunches and dinners are eaten out by yourself. Seafood is super cheap. All the snacks on the guide are like sand tea noodles, fried sea oysters, bamboo shoot jelly, ginger duck, etc. <br>2. Tour guide: The handsome tour guide Asu is humorous throughout the whole process. Since it is a large group with people from all over the country, the itinerary and accommodation are different, so the pick-up and drop-off arrangements must be very just right. The next day is Huli Mountain For the itinerary of the fort and Gulangyu Island, since our accommodation was close to the Hulishan fort, possibly because of the road arrangement, Asu sent a text message and called us in advance to inform us to take a taxi to the Hulishan fort at 8:20 in the morning, and return to Xiamen from Gulangyu Island on the third day. The supplementary ferry tickets were also fully reimbursed. On the last day of the return trip, since we lived the farthest away, it would be inconvenient for the bus to go there, so he himself used a taxi app to call a car to take us there. There was no heavy rain during the past few days of the trip, as we were worried about before, but it rained lightly every day during the trip, which was a unique mood. Aso did not hold an umbrella during the whole journey, and he explained to us carefully and told us what these attractions were. You will be fooled if something is not worth buying, and which things you can buy according to your own needs. <br>3. Attractions: I took the Xiagulang Ferry at noon the next day. There were really too many people. Due to the typhoon, the number of passengers on Gulangyu Island was probably less than in previous years. During the tour, I found that many ancient trees on the island had been destroyed. The typhoon blew it down, which was a pity to see. There are many local residents on the island, but the main business circle is more commercialized like Lijiang. Famous shops such as Zhang Sanfeng, Miss Zhao, Jasmine Tong, Pan Xiaolian, Chen Can Western Tea Shop, etc. are located in every corner. The third day was a cycle around the island, including Nanputuo Temple and Xiamen University. Since the group was all traveling to Zengcuo'an, only we and another pair of uncles and aunts who were both from Tianjin were able to ride, so we walked around Zengcuo'an. When Asu arranged bicycles for us, luckily we started riding. The weather was so beautiful that it didn’t rain at all. Our mood suddenly brightened. The four of us rode the tandem bicycles along the coastal road, went to the shore to take pictures and enjoyed the waves and beaches. Since Xiamen University is open all day on Saturdays and Sundays, and from Monday to Friday at noon and after 5:30 p.m., we had to queue up to enter at noon on Monday, and the scene was like being pushed in.",Postive
1111,1111,"This trip started very poorly. There was a big problem when I made the reservation on Tongcheng.com. I used the payment method of IOU plus down payment. There was a problem when I paid. My down payment was removed, but the IOU was not taken away. , causing my order to fail, but my down payment has been paid, and the order cannot be canceled. The problem was not solved until around 18:00 the next day when the order was placed at 18:00. During this period, the same customer service contacted me and told me that they There was a problem with the associated bank and they did not transfer my down payment to them, so my order failed. At the same time, the customer service actually asked me to pay another down payment (the associated bank was Minsheng Bank Chengdu Branch. I called China UnionPay and told me that the money had been paid. Transferred to the bank) I feel it is unreasonable to ask me to pay again because of the problems they have with the bank! It was finally resolved and I no longer wanted to pursue it! Let me talk about the itinerary: The person who picked me up at the airport in Xiamen on the first day was Master Zhang. He was very nice and very punctual. He took me to the Marshmallow Inn and drove into a small alley until the car could no longer be entered. Thank you very much! On the first day of free travel, I went to the beach. The inn is not far from the beach. It takes 10 minutes to walk (we walked very slowly with our children). We went to Zengcuo'an in the evening. Later, the tour guide Xiaolan (Lan Yinliang) called to make reservations. Two days trip! Special mention goes to the tour guide Xiaolan, a super good tour guide, caring and considerate throughout the whole process, super kind, and very humorous. I stayed at Gulangyu Island the second night and couldn't find an inn at night. I called Xiaolan to help solve everything. It's really Super good, absolutely ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ praise! On the second day, we stayed in a relatively ordinary place in Gulangyu (Huateng Diaoju). It was really a small house, but it was just for one night, so it was okay! On the third day, we visited Nanputuo, Xiamen University, and Zengcuo'an, and then stayed at Marshmallow. We said goodbye to the tour guide after 3 pm on the third day (my daughter was still a little reluctant to leave Uncle Xiaolan, and was a little melancholy). I will still be free in the future. It takes half a day. Returning on the fourth day, Master Zhang who picked us up from the airport may not have arranged a pick-up driver. There was a little incident in the morning, and Master Zhang finally called a special car to take him to the airport! The overall itinerary was okay. I am most grateful to the tour guide Xiaolan. He is the best tour guide in Xiamen!",Postive
1112,1112,"Meals are not included. I eat seafood and various fruits by myself. I stayed at the folk hotel Marshmallow. The boss is very nice and the environment is okay. The tour guide Zheng is very enthusiastic and has considerate service. Two bottles of water are given as a gift every day. The environment in Xiamen is also very good and the weather is not hot. This season is good! I ate a lot of mangoes and they tasted great. The oysters on Gulangyu Island cost eight yuan for ten yuan. The crabs were also big and the lobsters were delicious. All in all, it was a wonderful trip! Xiamen is not big. We spent two days. One day we were on Gulangyu Island and we stayed on the island. It was very lively. The urban area we visited the next day was also good. We must go to Yunshuiyao and Tulou next time. Time is tight this time. We look forward to next time! Beautiful! Big thumbs up!",Postive
1113,1113,"It's okay. It's inevitable that the time is tight when traveling with a group. I organized some free activities, so I felt a little tired. I traveled during the day and went out to eat and drink at night. There weren't many group meals, so I was more free, and I couldn't eat the group meal. I am used to it, so I can try the local snacks by myself... The only drawback is that they are quite delicious, but as a Shaanxi person who loves pasta and spicy food, I can try the food in the south, but I am still not used to it. The accommodation was okay, plus I paid for the room difference and stayed in a double room alone... I should arrange a day on Gulangyu Island. Some attractions are not necessary. I will still consider traveling together in the future. Online customization is very convenient and the full tracking service is available. The only frustration is The return flight was delayed all the time. In the end, it was delayed for 3 hours until I got off the plane at 2 a.m. when I originally planned to arrive at 11 a.m., which made the pick-up attendant wait for me for so long... I suggest you choose a non-stop flight or an earlier flight during the day.",Postive

Both Yitu Hotel and Pannuo Hotel in Gulangyu Island were very clean and the service was attentive. Because we had an extra bed, they also carefully provided a complete set of toiletries. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to have such accommodation and such a good itinerary at this price. There were no shopping spots during the trip, and no products were promoted.

1131,1131,"Accommodation: Yuehua Hotel is in good condition and the service is attentive, considerate and modest. Stayed in Room 121 on the first floor of Tianfeng Building for the first and second nights. It has complete facilities and a pleasant patio view outside. On the fourth night, I stayed in 311, Xinyue Building. The rooms in this building are large and the internal conditions are better than those in Tianfeng Building. However, they are not as quiet as Tianfeng Building 121. I was woken up by the sound of airplanes in my sleep. Those who are economical but afraid of noise can choose the first-floor rooms in Tianfeng Building, towards Yuehua Road. We stayed in Gulangyu Island for the third night. The conditions were worse than those on the main island of Xiamen. The purpose of staying in Gulangyu Island was just to stay for one night. Some things could only be ignored. There are overnight flights to Gulangyu Island, so if you are concerned about accommodation conditions, there is no need to stay in Gulangyu Island (it is inconvenient to do so with a group tour). Itinerary: Basically reasonable, except for the Tulou tour on the first day which was a bit tight, the rest was relatively relaxed. Because before going to Gulangyu Island on the third day of the group tour, I voluntarily added a Huli Mountain Fort itinerary at my own expense. Just as I wished, I was secretly happy. Food: The only group meal was Tulou Chinese food. There were 11 of us on the table and 10 of us had not yet finished the dishes. If you didn't finish the food, it could be because the portion was relatively large, or the food wasn't quite flavorful to everyone's taste. The local taste is light, and most outsiders are not used to it. The local dishes in Xiamen taste pretty good. The squid tastes fresher than the ones in Wuhan. It tastes good and impressive. The normal prices in Xiamen are similar to those in Wuhan, and the prices in scenic spots are basically more than double. For example, the price of Lao Bingbing is usually 3 times the normal price, and occasionally 2 times. The most outrageous thing is that the price of Xiamen University’s social service canteen (not the Furong Restaurant in the Graffiti Tunnel, but a restaurant here at the South Gate) is more expensive than the one on the high-speed rail, and the taste is worse than the one on the high-speed rail. Eating there means swallowing the food. If you want to experience the state of blandness, you might as well go to the restaurant of Xiamen University and try it! White rice is not provided, and a bowl of flower rice, which normally only costs 4 to 5 yuan, costs 20 yuan, which makes Xiamen University look polite! Transportation: The entire journey will be picked up and dropped off by the contract car. If it is not convenient to provide a vehicle within the scope of the contract, the fare will be reimbursed. Appreciation: 1. The third day of my trip was to stay at Gulangyu Island. It was only at 9 to 10 pm on the second day that I learned that my itinerary had been changed to stay at Yuehua Hotel for 4 nights. After I reported it to Tongcheng.com and **, they immediately checked and confirmed that my itinerary was wrong. They immediately made amends and dealt with it very quickly. I personally thought that the hotel I arranged may not be the default grade in the hotel contract, but I was impressed by their responsible attitude in solving the problem for me in a timely manner at night, without paying attention to the details. 2. When I returned to the hotel on the 4th night, I found that ** forgot to book a room for me. ** responded immediately after reporting the matter. A few hours later, the hotel informed me that the room type I needed was ready. If you change the room from Wenfeng Building to Xinyue Building, you will probably have to pay extra. The extra money to protect your reputation is worth appreciating. The standard rooms at Yuehua are very tight. The hotel staff have always paid attention to my affairs and immediately arranged for me as soon as a standard room became available. This reflects Yuehua's five-star service level. Thank you very much to the staff! Disadvantages: 1. I didn’t pay attention to details and made my Gulangyu itinerary wrong. 2. Due to the change in the Gulangyu itinerary, the plan to stay in Yuehua changed, and the correction was not followed up in time. The omission of booking a room was an error that should not have occurred. Management processes should be reviewed.",Postive

I don’t understand this very well, because after the call, a text message was sent to confirm the ID card, which means that the ticket was not purchased before, so why can’t the service be better and help the customer modify it in his system.

1172,1172,"1. This is a leisurely and enjoyable free trip to Xiamen. Xiamen is a seaside city with beautiful scenery. Here you can relax and stroll along the greenway around the island to experience the beauty of this city. I put down my luggage and went straight to the small fishing village of Zengcuo'an. Unfortunately, it no longer has the appearance of a fishing village, but various delicacies have become an attractive scenery here. I saw tourists passing by and smelled all kinds of delicacies. Mixed flavors. Then we walked across the overpass and walked slowly along the greenway around the island, watching and listening to the sea at Pearl Bay and Huli Bay beaches. Of course, we also went to the Huli Mountain Fort to visit and experience the style of the century-old fort. The next day we rented a car and went to Dadeng Island in Xiang'an, which is the closest to Kinmen Island. The main attraction here is the seat of the original Kinmen Island County government and administrative agencies. Most of the century-old buildings are well preserved, and the simple southern Fujian architectural style is refreshing. At the same time, we visited the Three Heroic Islands Battlefield Sightseeing Park on the island, which recreated the history of the shelling of Kinmen Island. There is a large banyan tree covering an area of ​​nearly an acre on the island, and many visitors have left their shadows behind. After leaving Dadeng Island, we first went to Nanputuo Temple (because Xiamen University only opens to the public at 17:30). The temple with Wulaofeng on its back is not only majestic but also imposing. The mountain peaks and the temple are dependent on each other. The scenery under the setting sun is beautiful and worth a visit. . It was already evening when we entered Xiamen University, and it was already dark in less than half an hour, so we only took a stroll around Furong Lake and failed to return home to the fullest. Back to the hotel, we visited the nearby ‘Minnan Ancient Town’. This is a modern building complex modeled after various Minnan architectural styles. It is actually a commercial city. On the third day, I headed to Gulangyu Island. Since I had purchased a round-trip ticket in Guangzhou from **, the round trip went smoothly. Gulangyu is indeed a beautiful island with mountains and beaches surrounded by the sea. Century-old buildings can be seen everywhere on the island, each with its own characteristics. The neat streets are crowded with tourists. Of course, delicious food is indispensable. If you want to slowly appreciate the mountains and scenery on the island, you can't finish it in just a few days. It is an island worth remembering. The morning of the fourth day continued with a stroll around the island, before heading back to the city to enjoy the sunshine and air at Bayfront Park. <br> Second, the warm and thoughtful service provided by Li Jiaying, the travel consultant who was traveling with us throughout the journey, as well as the services provided by China Southern Airlines, hotels, and airport pick-ups. Any problems found were solved in a timely manner, especially Miss Sun from Gulangyu Hotel, who not only reminded us We were also given hand-drawn maps on how to visit the relevant scenic spots on the island, which made our visit on the island relaxed and enjoyable. <br> We praised various services throughout the trip.",Postive
1173,1173,"The itinerary was great. I booked the Pan Pacific Hotel. I was very satisfied with the traffic environment in the city. There is also Chaofucheng near the hotel. There are many people for late night snacks, and the taste is not bad. The next day I went to Nanputuo Temple and Xiamen University Hotel. There is a bus in front of the hotel in 20 minutes. Rent a car at your destination and you can’t figure out the traffic conditions, so it’s easy to get stuck in taxis. Traveling by public transport is safe and worry-free; Nanputuo Temple is stunning in both its architecture and Buddha statues. It’s quite satisfying that the incense offerings are free and not commercialized; Xiamen University You can go to the Lu Xun Tan Kah Kee Xiamen University History Furong Restaurant at the entrance for snacks. There is a Furong Tunnel next to the Furong Restaurant. There are many students' creative graffiti that are very good. In the evening, if you go to the Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, there is a direct bus to the Xiamen University entrance. , there are a lot of snacks and seafood, and the taste is okay in a clean shop; on the third day, I went to Gulangyu Island, but I didn’t expect that there is no transportation on Gulangyu Island, so I have to go on my own. The hotel I booked in Pannuo is far away from the snacks and attractions on Longtou Road, but It’s relatively quiet. When choosing a hotel, be sure to choose one near Longtou Road so you don’t have to go back and forth. The 100 yuan ticket for the scenic spots on Gulangyu Island is good, but we went a little late and didn’t have time to finish the tour. If you are in a hurry, it is recommended to buy tickets at the door, otherwise it will be wasted. You must go to Shuzhuang Garden and Sunlight Rock. There is no other meaning. In the evening, of course, we have to go to the snack street on Longtou Road. Turkish ice cream, Shenjia rice rolls, Xiaoma Ge potatoes, etc.; on the fourth day, we slept in in the afternoon. We found a cafe to sit and chat while we flew home in the evening. <br>I need to remind everyone that Xiamen is very cold at night in March, so you must wear a coat. My friends and I were very hot in the sun during the day without a coat, and it was really freezing at night. Don’t let the heat of the day fool you! <br>That’s about it.

1174,1174,"Traveling during festivals is really troublesome due to the large number of people, and everything is more expensive than usual.

All taxis turned away passengers, and the price was at least double. Only then are they willing to travel. That’s understandable. Is it the Spring Festival? The customer service attitude of Tongcheng is good. Peipei can still serve us during the Spring Festival. The room in the Beijing-Fujian Center Hotel is small and other service hardware is OK. Penghuwan Road at my grandma's house is difficult to walk. It is not recommended to stay with heavy luggage. The room is relatively simple. , a shabby little hotel.

During the day, it is Xiagu Cruise Terminal, and at night, there is another dock option. I am also quite satisfied with the hotel. Both Gulang Villa and Pullman are relatively clean areas. The beach in front of Gulang Villa is very quiet at night. Gulangyu Island is very beautiful at night with various lights and many ancient trees. Over 10,000 people have walked there every day in the past few days. It's more than 5,000 steps and I can't stop at all. I walked around most of the island. There are also many places with few tourists that are very interesting. The food on the island is okay and not very expensive. Don't go to the one near the pier in Xiamen. The food in the beautiful commercial street is expensive but not delicious. The small restaurants opened by locals for snacks have a very local flavor. It’s best to do some planning before setting off, otherwise you’ll be on the wrong path, as the road is quite complicated. On the third day, I went to Xiamen Pullman and took a taxi from the pier for 14 yuan. There are buses No. 8 and No. 26 at the door, and they have to reverse. Route 8 goes to Zhongshan Park. It is the main way to travel these days. It is recommended to take the bus when going out. You can also choose to ride a bicycle when you come back. There are many uphills when going out and many downhills when coming back. If you are in good physical condition, you can ride a bike uphill all the way to the Botanical Garden. It is recommended to walk back from the Strange Slope. Follow the railway at an intersection with a railway and enter the Railway Park, go through it and go around to the gate of the main scenic area of ​​the Botanical Garden. Enter from the Strange Slope. There is a long climb up the mountain road on the other side of the slope. The conductor confirmed that we had to climb up before selling us tickets. Although it was tiring, it was very clean and there were almost no people on the road. The breakfast at Pullman is richer than that at Gulang Villa, but less compared to its peers, and much less than at Pullman in Yalong Bay.

After landing on the island, I took a quick look, my dear, it was really noisy with gongs and drums, firecrackers were blasting (this is a bit exaggerated), the mountains and the sea are so beautiful! How can we find someone to catch up with Wenqing? ! Haha, don’t be afraid, why don’t we stay on the island for one night? The Pannuo Holiday Hotel arranged on the same trip is comfortable and clean, and the location is not too great. The pier is right outside the door, haha! In the evening, after waiting for the various tourist groups to leave the island, I walked with my wife along the coast and had a romantic trip. On the last day, Xiamen ground pick-up called me in advance to confirm the drop-off time and arrange it on time. A special car took us to the airport to end our free trip to Xiamen. To be honest, I was a little reluctant to leave. Finally, I would like to add that because we had some changes to our itinerary and accommodation, Tongcheng immediately helped me make adjustments after we proposed it. , the service is really impeccable! Five-star reviews are a must. If there are six-star reviews, I will give them six stars. Haha😊 I’ll look for Tongcheng next time I travel! ! !",Postive
1200,1200,"This time it was perfect! Although I was traveling alone, the itinerary I arranged was not lonely at all. The airport pick-up service was very good and the proactive contact was very good. The last night was to go to Gulangyu Island and then go directly to the airport. This was changed when the airport pick-up manager contacted me one day in advance. The location is changed directly to the pier. Let’s talk about the hotel first. The DoubleTree Hilton Hotel includes two breakfasts. The overall environment of the hotel is very good. It is an executive hotel after all. The breakfast is not bad. The dishes are slightly less but they are all delicious. I usually only book executive hotels like this with business travel companies. If I have any questions, I can resolve them within 3 minutes with just one phone call. Also, I received a large cookie when I checked in, which was super delicious! It felt like first love! All in all, I can't fault this hotel. It should be noted that not many people frequent five-star executive hotels like this. The tea, tea bags, coffee and mineral water in small bags in the drawer in the room are free, just like for couples. There is a charge for disposable items, bottles of drinks and food, and they are not cheap. <br><br>The hotel is nice, but a bit remote. The nearest one is Wuyuan Bridge. Although Xiamen is very warm in January, the sea breeze is also very cold! It gave me a fever in the middle of the night...Taking a taxi is no traffic jam (compared to Beijing), and it’s not very expensive. Most of the tourist attractions you want to visit are quite far away. Taking a taxi from the hotel to Zhongshan Road is equivalent to traveling north to south across the entire island. , about 40-50rmb, using Didi just in time to catch up with 50% off UnionPay Quick Pass, Apple Pay decisively~<br><br>Zhongshan Road can be regarded as the combination of Beijing’s Nanluoguxiang + Wangfujing. There are also big-name and serious ones. There are also snacks and specialty shops. However, there is a shop called Xiamen Souvenirs. I bought some specialties there, which were a bit expensive. When I left, I bought three boxes of cigarettes, two boxes were given away, and the remaining box was smoked by myself. I found that the cigarettes were a bit fake. . There is also a shop called Yifengqingsu, which is really delicious. The snacks are made with many exquisite flavors. It is very useful for flirting with girls and guys! I was almost turned on by the little brother inside! <br><br>My purchases on Zhongshan Road were all free shipping on my first day, and I started playing as soon as I finished the purchase. The scenic spots are all near Zhongshan Road, and there is also a fort on Baicheng Beach. You can spend half a day to slow down your pace. The sand is very clean and the sea water is very salty... In the evening there are some small activities on the beach, which is very interesting. <br><br>Be sure to spend a whole day exploring Xiamen University! The students in the university are very enthusiastic and the environment is beautiful. The Furong Tunnel is worth seeing because it is the talent of the students. Looking at it reminds me of the group of brothers back then. <br><br>It is best to book Gulangyu Island ferry tickets in advance. Don’t be like me. It took two hours on December 31st to get a ticket for January 1st. <br><br>Gulangyu Island has no shared bicycles or buses. It is just a small island with some stories and beautiful scenery, including wedding photography. Very beautiful. <br><br>There are many attractions to visit. Coming to this city is more about finding a more authentic self, slowing down, putting down the mouse and keyboard, and turning off the lights. Put away the disgusting photoshop, take your eyes away from excel and ppt on the screen, and experience life carefully and enjoy life.",Postive

Because I was struggling with all kinds of worries when booking the trip, my colleague said it’s better to book with Tongcheng. The service here is better. Okay, I booked all my travels here, and then I decisively chose Tongcheng. When I selected the order, the customer service guy helped me. The service was great and he answered all my questions. I also got a 100 yuan discount. It didn’t look like a certain cow. …The day before departure, the driver who picked us up took the initiative to contact us and asked us to call after we got off the plane. We were waiting near the airport soon after we got off the plane. The hotel we stayed at was the Sheraton, which had great service and all the facilities! The Sheraton is in the city center, so it is very convenient to take a taxi to any scenic spot we go to. If we take a taxi, we can go to Zhongshan Road, Dongdu Wharf, Nanputuo Temple, Xiamen University, etc. for about 20 yuan! By the way, don’t forget to pick up a map of Xiamen at the airport when you get off the plane. You can order ferry tickets to Gulangyu Island from here. Many souvenirs can be mailed directly to the airport or home~ The roads in Xiamen are very clean. They are all very friendly~ The young men and women in the Gulangyu store are all very good-looking! This season is perfect for going there, the weather is neither too cold nor too hot. On the way back, the driver arrived at the hotel in advance and the service was great!

There were not many people (booked with Alipay in advance). After 20 minutes of walking, we arrived at Gulangyu Island and found a tour guide who took us to the hotel and cabin where we stayed. , parent-child room, as well as children's toys and snacks, very considerate! After that, the tour guide took us for a walk. In the afternoon, we went to Longtou Road Snack Street. You can’t refuse and continue to eat. In the evening, seafood and beer are still not cheap, haha! ! <br>On the fifth day, I woke up and had breakfast (the breakfast was very mediocre). After walking around for a while, I took a boat to Xiagu Pier at 11:40, and a driver took me to the airport! We had a meal at the airport, haha. We stopped in Nantong and were delayed for an hour. We arrived at Shenyang Taoxian Airport at 8:28! ! Go home! <br>Summary: The airport pick-up staff was enthusiastic, the Pan Pacific room was nice, and the waiter’s attitude was very good!

The Yuehua Hotel is a little remote. It costs about 30 more to go to Chinatown and other places by calling Didi's private car, but it takes almost two or three minutes to call for a private car, which is super convenient! The villa hotel in Gulangyu Island is really on the seaside. It only takes about ten minutes to walk to the pier. On the last day, I had to catch a flight at 9:30 in the morning, so I didn’t enjoy the hotel’s breakfast early in the morning. I went to catch the ferry early and went to the airport.

There is a special car to pick you up from the airport and back to the hotel. The driver will contact you in advance to confirm, which is very convenient. The Pan Pacific Hotel has average facilities, and the subway is being built downstairs. Fortunately, the breakfast is rich. I visited a lot of scenic spots on this trip, and I felt it was okay, except that sailing on a yacht was a bit tricky. Also, Xiamen University needs to make a reservation ** in advance, otherwise you won’t be able to get in. Along the way, I ate all the snacks in Xiamen, and also tried some Hakka food, which tasted pretty good. Although it was tiring after a few days, I gained a lot.

But after calling customer service, they arranged it immediately. The service attitude was also very good. The only regret is that I didn’t go to Xiamen University and didn’t see the Furong Tunnel. , you have to miss the military training period to go to Xiamen, otherwise Xiamen University will not allow outsiders to enter. Some parts of Cat Street are still under renovation, which is quite unique, but it is very small and there are not many cats. There is a Cat Street Museum or something.

The hotel's breakfast buffet is still very good. The rest is okay. I would like to remind everyone that it is really not recommended to go to the underwater world of Gulangyu Island.

1209,1209,"The itinerary is to go back on the 16th and return on the 19th. When I went, the strongest typhoon ""Mangkhut"" happened to be approaching Guangzhou. I was afraid that it would affect the rest of the trip, but the fact is that the flight was not delayed at all and it didn't rain. I asked. The guy who picked us up at the airport (ps: Cao Cao’s special car was arranged for the airport pick-up and was very helpful) said it was just a bit windy. When you go to the hotel to check in, the front desk will ask you whether you want to upgrade and the corresponding benefits. It only costs 150 per day. Because I am alone and go shopping and eating, I politely declined. I was assigned a deluxe double room on the 17th floor with a view of the sea. The bed was really big, soft and very comfortable. There was nothing wrong with the hotel. It was great, great, great, and the service was very good. There is a subway in front of the hotel, but it does not affect travel. I basically take Didi wherever I go, and it usually costs about 30 yuan (ps: I always take Didi Youxiang, and the attitude is very good. They all use petrol and electricity. Mixed, very stable. There is basically no possibility of walking more) There are many buses in Xiamen that can basically go anywhere. I usually take Didi for about 30 yuan to go to far places. If I take the bus to Zhongshan Road, I choose to take the Huweishan bus. It takes about 10 minutes to walk. Go straight on the right when you exit the hotel. This is the same line to go to the International Pier and Gulangyu Island (ps: If you go to the pier, it is recommended to walk on the opposite side. If you take the normal walking path, you have to go around for a few minutes longer. I am a person who has been there.) I don’t think you have to go for this dish based on the online reputation. Sometimes it is not that delicious. I still recommend the Yuehuasha Tea Noodle Bar on Zhongshan Road, it’s pretty good. Xiamen is beautiful everywhere. Looking forward to your next trip.",Postive

It's just that it cost a lot of money to change the flight, otherwise the flight time would be too bad and people would be tired. I hope that I can do some reasonable independent travel in the same city in the future, especially the flight time, so I have to choose the right time. Try to arrange a better car for intra-city pick-up and drop-off. When going out to play, the important thing is to experience. We also spent a day going to Yunshuiyao.

I have to say that Xiamen's five-star hotels are relatively average. The rooms are very small and stuffy. There are big mirrors everywhere in the room to make it look spacious, but it looks very uncomfortable. There seems to be no place to eat near the hotel except for a KFC. There is a Haitian Lou Chinese restaurant on the fourth floor of the hotel. The a la carte is more expensive, but the Cantonese buffet is good for 138 people.

1225,1225,"The hotel was newly opened in September. It is a luxury hotel. The service attitude and equipment are really good. However, I am a little disappointed that the swimming pool inside is not open yet. Moreover, it is far away from the main tourist attractions in Xiamen. Take a taxi to Xiamen University. The price of Zengcuo'an If you are in your fifties or sixties, it is not suitable for those who mainly come to travel. I booked the ferry ticket to Gulangyu Island in advance on **. If you have travel plans, you can buy it in advance. I bought it the day before departure, so it is almost impossible during the peak tourist season. We couldn’t buy it, otherwise Xiamen would feel like we were wasting our time. When we went back to the airport, the master set a time for us to pick us up at 12.40. We were anxious and asked the master to come earlier, but there was no time, so we took a taxi to the airport ourselves. Overall, it was okay. Well, the mangoes included in the order are huge. delicious",Postive

The conditions of the Gulang Villa Hotel are a little worse, but it is still worth it on Gulang Island. On the first day, after getting off the plane, we took the airport express line to Zhongshan Road. For lunch, we had Sha Cha Noodles and Oyster Omelette, drank Ba Po Po’s Shao Xian Cao, and got some mango for lunch. Then go to the hotel to check in, and then go to Xiamen University Baicheng Beach in the afternoon. The next morning I went to Hulishan Fort. I missed the queue at Xiamen University at noon, so I went directly to Zengcuo'an. I came back to Xiamen University at 5:30 in the evening and had dinner at Xiamen University.

You won’t be sluggish just because it’s a group buying. Remember to buy your boat tickets in advance when going to Gulangyu Island. On-site tickets will be sold out after 3pm. The hotel we booked on the same trip was also very good. Needless to say, the Sheraton was great! Gulangyu’s hotels are also among the top-ranked hotels on the island.

The Pan Pacific Hotel on the first day was good, but the one on Gulangyu Island was a bit less so, but it was still clean. Gulangyu Island in Xiamen was the most fun place to stay. If you are on the island, you can play longer at night, which is good. It's just that our itinerary is tight, otherwise it would be better. Let's talk about the local car pick-up. The driver's attitude is very good. Because the flight was delayed, we arrived an hour late. He immediately arranged for another car to pick us up without making us wait. When we came back, we contacted him and asked him to pick us up at the place where we were visiting. His attitude was kind and flexible, which brought us convenience. We are very satisfied with the same trip every time. The itinerary did not disappoint me. This time, I am particularly grateful to customer service Li Jian.

It is very warm and a good choice for business and office. In addition, the hotel includes breakfast. The breakfast is rich and there are many choices. The service attitude is very good. The comfortable accommodation environment helps relieve the fatigue of travel! There are still many scenic spots worth visiting in Xiamen. I couldn’t finish them all in 4 days.

It is very convenient to buy things in a small supermarket similar to a convenience store. During the three nights here, we had two meals of dumplings from all directions downstairs. The whole family liked it very much. We plan to stay here. Friends nearby can give it a try. There is No. 31 at the door, which goes directly to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. It is not far from Xiagu Pier. Since Xiamen taxis can only carry four people, the five of us couldn’t take it, so we had to get on Didi before going out. Book a car. <br> The accommodation on Gulangyu Island is average. The service attitude of the security men in the lobby is better than that of the front desk. There is really nothing to eat for breakfast. I want to complain about the process of getting to the hotel. Since the guide was not prepared in advance, I chose the one farthest from the hotel. We arrived at the Sanqiutian Pier on the island, and we didn’t know that we could book a shuttle bus with the hotel in advance. As a result, it took us an hour to get to the hotel with our slippers and suitcases, and it took us an hour to get to the hotel. Why did this happen? It was mainly because the head of my household Because we don’t understand the terrain and trust the navigation at home, the process of finding a hotel is too difficult, which makes us no longer in the mood to visit the long-awaited Gulangyu Island, including Longtou Road, Sunlight Rock, and Shuzhuang Garden😭< br> Although there are regrets, the overall feeling is quite good.

The restaurants are also pretty good and there are many choices within walking distance. On a free day, I rode a motorcycle around Xiamen Island. Five hours, eighty kilometers. The scenery in Siming Duan is still beautiful, but the feeling of Gulangyu Island is bland. There are huge crowds. You have to board the boat from Dongdu Pier.

I also invited my friends and family to go with me. <br>Tongcheng's service was very good from beginning to end. The breakfast at the hotel we stayed in was also rich and the end time was late, which was very convenient for families with children like us. <br>The advantage of independent travel is that you can make your own arrangements.

The Sheraton Hotel is located near Metro Line 1, and it is very convenient to travel by bus and subway.

The hotel also has a swimming pool and a gym. We stayed at the Gulang Villa Hotel in Gulangyu Island, which is the location for extreme challenge shooting. The breakfast was also very rich. The hotel also gave the baby beach toys. The beach was right outside the hotel. We got up early and played on the beach for a long time. It was very enjoyable and we could enjoy it in the weather. When it's hot, we can rest in the hotel, swim in the swimming pool, and stroll around the beach and the lively Longtou Road in the morning and evening. I also want to thank the Tongcheng consultant who patiently answered questions, helped us contact the hotel, and provided airport pick-up and drop-off. The driver always contacted us in advance and arrived early. He was so considerate. All in all, it was a very pleasant trip and worth recommending.",Postive
1239,1239,"The whole journey went smoothly. If I encountered any problems, I reported them to Tongcheng’s customer service and they were handled very promptly. I’m very satisfied with this. The overall tourism environment in Xiamen feels good, and there is no malicious behavior to rip off customers. The taste of the small glasses food stalls is sweet, salty and quite delicious. The prices of seafood are transparent and the hand-shredded cabbage is very spicy. Accommodation in the city is at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Xiamen , the location is convenient, and the rooms are relatively clean and spacious. The only drawback is that there is only an outdoor swimming pool. The water temperature in early July is still quite cold. The hotel management is very strict. You cannot go upstairs when ordering takeout, nor can you hand it over to the front desk or security. The delivery boy only You can wait outside the door; Gulangyu Pannuo Holiday Hotel is very close to Neicuo'ao Pier. It's just a few steps away with your luggage, which is very convenient. There will be showers in Xiamen in the afternoon, and they will come as soon as they come, and they will stop after a while. During the summer vacation, Xiamen University has two centralized admission times a day. Just go early and queue up. There is no limit on the number of visitors. Don’t be fooled by the aunties. The so-called priority admission for 10 yuan per person means that you can squeeze to the front and jump in the queue. The paths on Gulangyu Island are complicated and divided into small and large ones. You will see several bifurcated roads with the same name on the map. Mobile phone navigation can also be misleading. You still need to ask more people for directions. There are no cars on the island. The elderly and children can take battery cars near the pier. Take a walk around, there are many slopes on the island, and walking is very tiring. Children can go to the beach to play in the sand, or they can go to the Shell Museum, which is built in a cave and has a rich collection and is very informative. There are several beaches on Gulangyu Island, the best of which is Meihua Beach. The sand is quite fine, but the sea water has a fishy smell and is not suitable for swimming in the sea.

Moreover, the environment on the island is not bad, and many inns have sea views. Yes, but the price is not cheaper than hotels in the city. In addition, don’t go to some seafood restaurants on Gulangyu Island. They are expensive and unpalatable. If you want to eat, just go straight to Longtou Road. I personally recommend eating seafood at the buffet in the hotel. Although it will be more expensive, but The food is safe and there are many kinds. I recommend Lujiang Hotel here, the price is reasonable, more than 200 per person. Another thing about renting a car for cycling on Huandao Road. The public bicycles currently promoted in Xiamen can be used directly after downloading the app and scanning the QR code on the bicycle. It only costs 1 yuan per hour, because it is a bicycle and not a two-person or three-person bicycle. So if you are in need, just rent it honestly (ps. The most important thing is that it is very difficult to get this kind of bicycle with QR code - -)",Postive

Pan Pacific should be considered 4 and a half stars in the star rating, but the service is absolutely superb, surpassing that of a five-star hotel. They welcome guests, help with luggage, and clean the room twice a day. Every item is taken care of very thoughtfully. Thumbs up! Because in Xiamen to prepare for the BRICS meeting, the entire city is under construction, but it does not affect the fun, but there is a bit of traffic jam. A typical itinerary can cover all the iconic attractions in 4 days. After getting off the plane and settling in, you can go to Zhongshan Road, then go to Zengcuotan in the evening, and the next day you can go to Putuo Temple. If you don’t believe in Buddhism, just go and visit it. When you go to Baicheng Beach, you can continue Dianping to find a unique place to eat in the evening. When you go to Gulangyu Island on the third day, you must book your tickets in advance. It is very convenient, but the new pier is very big! It costs 1 yuan to take a bus in Xiamen, so you need to prepare coins. If you are not in a hurry, it is actually very convenient to take the bus. The map will tell you which bus to take. Of course, taking a taxi is not expensive. Xiamen is a paradise for foodies. Ba Popo burns grass jelly and grilled squid. Absolutely unforgettable! Those who bring children must bring a stroller.

It should be the same trip for so many years. Changing habits and traveling independently is also quite worry-free and labor-saving. As the most fashionable hotel under InterContinental, Hotel Indigo is indeed different from the five-star hotels in my impression. It does not have a luxurious lobby or large enough guest rooms. But judging from the ultra-quiet elevator and the quality of the breakfast, it still maintains a five-star standard. The guest rooms are exquisite and cleverly decorated, and the Toto washlet and Hansgrohe shower are not useless. But there are two things I am not particularly satisfied with. 1. Intercontinental does not proactively provide turn-down service. 2. The bar next door is very noisy. If you live on the 9th floor, you can still hear the music coming from late at night, but it doesn't matter to young people who go to bed late. It ends after one o'clock. It feels good to wake up and see the ocean. The flight time is optional and there is a small fee. A taxi from the airport costs about 50 yuan.

1249,1249,"I have been back from Xiamen for a few days, and I have thought about it carefully and decided to write down my feelings. It is a completely subjective feeling, so you can refer to it selectively. Let’s talk about Tongcheng’s service first. It’s very meticulous and in place. The service details are great! We had an early morning flight on April 21st. After getting off the plane, a friend on the same trip came to pick us up. We arrived at the Pan Pacific Hotel at noon. The hotel is not a resort, it is purely business, so the entertainment items are only a swimming pool and a gym, and there is nothing else. So I chose this hotel because it is basically in the center of various scenic spots, especially close to the pier to Gulangyu Island. The bus is only 2 stops away from the door. There are also other hotels such as Xiamen University, Zengcuo'an, and Huandao Road that cost about 20 yuan by taxi. Direct bus access, very convenient. Another unexpected surprise is that because the hotel is a business hotel, the service is very considerate. There are no people coming and going and noisy like a resort hotel. The buffet is also good and the waiters are very enthusiastic! There are two important points to say about travel. Gulangyu Island ferry tickets must be booked in advance. We still book tickets for 2 days later if we travel on normal days, so we must book in advance. Search Xiamen Ferry Co., Ltd. **, in * You can book it online at *. Just swipe your ID card and enter the port directly. If you bring a baby under 1.2 meters tall, you can go to the ticket office 40 minutes in advance to get a free ticket for your baby. Another point is that Zengcuo'an has become too commercial. Several streets are all about frying this and frying that. How about some live opening of shells to get pearls? There is no literary flavor at all. I don't think there is much to the various online delicacies. It's delicious. Maybe it's because I'm from the north, so I just gave it a try. I will never eat it again. Xiamen University is worth visiting to feel the atmosphere of Southern University. It’s quite good. If you don’t have enough time, it is recommended to take a taxi to Xiamen University. After visiting, you can find Mobikes everywhere. You can ride to Huandao Road to enjoy the sea breeze, and then ride to Zengcuo’an. , the distance is very close, just in the same direction. My favorite is Gulangyu Island. If you have the chance, you can stay on the island for a day. It is very quiet and relaxing. You enjoy life very much. It is very artistic. I photographed an old couple going shopping hand in hand on the island, which was very touching. It is truly a blessing in life to be able to choose someone to live in such a paradise for the rest of your life!",Postive

First of all, I would like to thank my dedicated customer service Zhang Cong for his enthusiastic and patient service. Even though I changed my travel location several times, he was still very attentive in helping me recommend suitable projects. . Since I was traveling with my best friend and my kids, I just wanted them to have fun, and this product turned out to be very suitable. The Hainan Airlines flight we chose left early and returned early, first to Gulangyu Island and then to Xiamen, so we made full use of our time. After arriving in Xiamen, we were picked up and taken directly to Dongdu Pier (download the Xiamen Ferry Company app on your mobile phone in advance to buy tickets. The luxury cruise I bought cost 50 yuan for a round trip. For children under 1.2m, go to the pier to exchange for free tickets with your ID card. Children 25 yuan. Half-price ticket) swipe your ID card to board the ship. I would like to remind everyone not to buy maps and stamped books on the ship, because they are available on the island and are cheap. The hotel we booked on Gulang Island is Gulang Villa Hotel. It is far away from the island's attractions, but it is clean, close to the sea, and right outside the ""Gulang Stone"". The room is small, but everything else is pretty good. There are not many kinds of breakfast, which is acceptable for us with children. Special reminder not to eat at the Gulang Villa Seafood Restaurant written on the first floor. It is an absolute scam. There was no problem at all walking around the island. We walked around every street in two days without feeling tired. Therefore, for people who are accustomed to walking, it is not a problem to complete Gulangyu Island in one day! The other reviews of the attractions are very comprehensive, so I won’t go into details ^o^ Another complaint is that all kinds of queues to buy food are caused by the chain effect of slow merchants. I don't have the guts to buy some small portions and try them, then I'll be full. The ticket to the Fish Bone Museum is 35 yuan, which is a small personal studio. If you want to go to all attractions, finally buy a combined ticket! Every street in Gulangyu Island feels very comfortable and clean. Children’s favorite thing is the beach! In short, Gulangyu, five stars! After breakfast, I checked out and took the ferry back to Xiamen. It cost 50 yuan to take a taxi to the Sheraton Hotel. The hotel environment is very good and I checked in quickly. There is a fee for children over 4 years old, because you can get a 20% discount with a membership card, which is about 55 per child. . Because what we were thinking about at that time was to live well, so we were far away from the attractions. However, the doorman will help call a car before you go out, so it's not too much trouble. Xiamen University, Zengcuo'an, Guanyin Mountain, Huli Mountain, Botanical Garden, Nanputuo, Yanwu Bridge, cycling around the island... I spent two days enjoying Xiamen. Due to the renovation of Xiamen Zhengzheng City, all roads were under construction and the haze was shrouded. It's not as good as expected at all... You still can't do without the beach when you have children. The sand near Xiamen University Baicheng and Pearl Bay is very fine and suitable for children to play. Forget about the beach at Guanyin Mountain! In addition, I also went to the Guanyin Mountain Dream Amusement Park to experience the feeling of private play, but the facilities there are relatively old, and many items must be above 1.3m to play. My daughter is less than 1.2m, and the 105 group purchase ticket is enough. We played on a Ferris wheel 🎡 and a pirate ship, and finally we spent 20 to feed the fish^o^. The unsatisfactory part is that due to air traffic control, the plane was delayed for more than 3 hours, and it was already past two o'clock in the morning when we returned to Beijing! I hope my comments can be helpful to everyone!",Postive
1251,1251,"I took two children and an old man out to play before the Chinese New Year. I chose the afternoon flight on the first day and took me to Xiamen. A chef came to pick me up soon and took me directly to the hotel. After that, I went to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. We ate various snacks such as Sha Cha Noodles, and strolled around the pedestrian street, which was very lively at night. We went to Gulangyu Island the next day, and walked around, and went to the Upside Down Museum. The children were very happy to take pictures, and they also ate pancakes made by internet celebrities. There was a long queue for the fruit, but it didn’t taste as good as I expected. On the third day, I went to Xiamen University and walked through the Furong Tunnel. It was a long tunnel, probably two kilometers long. I originally planned to go to Baicheng. We went for a walk on the beach, but when we took a taxi, the taxi driver recommended us to go sailing. If we were lucky, we might see dolphins, but we didn’t see anything. When we came back, we went to Zeng Cuo’an and ate Shaoxiancao. My kids They all love to eat and went to the beach opposite for a long time. It was a tiring but happy day. The last day was a flight in the afternoon. I originally planned to go to the Science and Technology Museum, but ended up staying in the hotel in the afternoon. Finally, I complained about the hotel. When checking in, they told us that we were two adults and two children, and recommended that we upgrade to a deluxe room. But the result was just like that, we spent more than 100 yuan a night. Breakfast is the most unreasonable. There are not many varieties. Children over 1.4 meters tall cost 117 per person. This price is too expensive.",Postive

The pick-up master was waiting very early At the ✈️ airport, even though our flight was delayed, we were greeted very warmly ❤️ and felt a bit like a VIP. We stayed at the five-star Pan Pacific 🏨 in the city center. The location is excellent. It is convenient to take the bus to various attractions. It costs only one yuan to walk around. The Chaofu City opposite the hotel 👍 has endless aftertaste! Three nights at the Pacific Hotel and one night at Gulangyu Island. Because there was a BRICS conference when I went there, the bus driver reminded me to buy the ferry tickets early, otherwise it would be troublesome to get to the island. It is recommended that you buy tickets at ** for convenience. One ticket costs 35 round trip. , the time limit for entering the island is stipulated, you can leave and leave the island at will, just swipe your ID card when entering and leaving the island! Gulangyu is an island that fulfills all your fantasies. If you want to take beautiful photos, bring more beautiful clothes😏Stay at the Garden Hotel on the island. The location is beautiful and the scenery is beautiful, but the room conditions are poor... All in all, it was a pleasant experience✈️",Postive

As soon as we got off the train, the driver couldn't wait to call me and ask me where I was. My friend was even rushed to the toilet because the weather was bad. Hot attitude is very bad. After getting on the bus, the driver may have calmed down and chatted with us. That’s okay~. Don't care~. The airport drop-off service was very good and the time arrangement was very reasonable. There was another major mistake. Tongcheng sent me the seat number of the EMU car, so I didn’t know my seat after getting on the train and asked several local passengers. This is Tongcheng's mistake. The hotel is great. After all, you get what you pay for. The more expensive ones are better than the more expensive ones, which are very classy. I highly recommend the Pullman Hotel. The security system is very good and you have to go through the security check before entering the elevator. The hotels on Gulangyu Island have good external facilities and appearance, but are a bit shabby and ordinary on the inside. Overall, it’s good ~ Like it 👍",Postive

Hahaha, yes, I am such a retard~ <br>The hotel is not far from the airport, and the hotel is also very close to other attractions. It was 11 o'clock in the evening when we arrived in Xiamen. Check-in was very fast, and the hotel's service was also very good. . <br>There are a lot of delicious foods in Xiamen, but we two fake foodies looked at so many delicious things but ended up eating very little. We ate the shark balls, sand tea noodles, Ba Po Po, Zhang Sanfeng, etc. that we were longing for. The mangoes were really good. It’s very cheap, and it also has jukou noodles. It’s in a very hidden alley. We searched it on Weibo and found it. The noodles are okay, but the soup is really delicious and very fresh. We don’t like seafood. Everyone thinks it tastes good. <br>I went to Putuo Temple. In fact, I may have made a wish, but he didn’t know. Hahaha, I will still go to Xiamen again.

But in terms of location, it's too remote. The Le Meridien I booked is very close to Xiamen University, Gulangyu Island, and Zhongshan Street, but this Nikko Hotel is really too remote. It’s difficult to even call a taxi. Every time you have to pay a fare increase of 20 yuan before a driver can take the order, and the metered driving distance to each scenic spot is nearly 50 yuan, not including the fare increase, which is simply frustrating! ! ! And the driver cheated on you without discussing it! ! ! There were people everywhere. I couldn’t book a ferry ticket to Gulangyu Island two days in advance. In the end I didn’t go to Gulangyu Island. Such a price is so annoying in Xiamen. I will never go to Xiamen again.",Postive
1256,1256,"The overall itinerary was very satisfactory. I liked Gulangyu Island. The beach was very quiet. There were a lot of people in Xiamen. After all, I went there during the Spring Festival. This trip went smoothly for both the elderly and the young. The pick-up and drop-off from the airport was very convenient, and the hotels we stayed in were pretty good. The hotel on Gulangyu Island was right opposite the beach, and the breakfast was a bit poor. The bed of the Pacific Hotel in Xiamen is slightly smaller, but the environment, location and breakfast are very good. Especially Chaofu City opposite has good refreshments. Thanks to Tongcheng, the overall travel is quite hassle-free. I will choose to go to Xiamen and Gulangyu in the off-season next time. Stay for a few days and experience the slow life on the beach. Fortunately, a hotel reminded me to buy a boat ticket to Gulangyu Island in advance, otherwise I wouldn’t be able to go to Daola. I didn’t eat much seafood this time, but I would recommend a Western restaurant near Bailuzhou, which is really good. It feels good to sit very leisurely. In short, Xiamen, especially Gulangyu Island, is quite good. There are also many snacks, and they all taste good. It is recommended to visit Zhongshan Road. I don’t feel very good about Zeng Cuo’an. Mainly when we went there, there were too many people and it was too crowded, which made the experience very bad. Let’s go and experience it next time when there are fewer people.",Postive

I originally remembered to change change, but... I forgot! As a result, when I went to Xiamen, took the bus to Zengcuo'an, and went to Xiamen University, I always asked for change from the hotel to buy a bottle of water! The whole trip is green. Xiamen buses are very convenient. Rich people can feel free to do so~ I found something very strange: there are no ** and ** buckets on the road? I found ** buckets on the bus the whole time... Let’s talk about the hotel~ Pan Pacific is close to the cruise center terminal, which can be reached by bus 87 and l5. Then take a boat to Gulangyu Island~ Chaofu City opposite is also very delicious~ The hotel The breakfast buffet is great and the service is attentive. Let’s talk about eating and drinking: You can go to Zeng Cuo’an during the day and night. Xiamen University recommends going on weekends. There are gates from Monday to Friday. Zhongshan Road is very lively at night. I recommend Zeng Cuo’an for snacks and Zhongshan Road for souvenirs. If you enjoy Xiamen University, you can Go directly to Baicheng Beach, then Zengcuo'an, one route! very convenient. You can walk around Gulangyu Island for free and try souvenir samples for free. The waiters are very enthusiastic and keep stuffing you with them. You can eat coconut pies until you are full. The fish ball shop on Longtou Road is delicious. 10 fish balls for 10 yuan each. , the strength of springing teeth. For rice rolls, I had to go to a store with a lot of people queuing up and a lot of medals at the door. I bought the wrong one and took one bite...thrown it away...it's delicious and famous, Ba Po Po Shao Xiancao +, Ba Po Po Xiao Long, very good For food, I ate at Zeng Cuo'an, and the Quangu Noodle Shop in Zeng Cuo'an. The noodles and kumquat lemon noodles there are simply delicious. In addition, the grilled sausages in Xiamen University are also delicious, costing 5 yuan a portion. , crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. For souvenirs, I recommend Shop No. 7, Liumang Deeds. Anyway, you can try it for free and you can eat as much as you want, because there are many shops together! Finally, I have to talk about the Little Eye Food Stalls. They are delicious, good quality and cheap. They are located near Zhongshan Road and near the Botanical Garden. Take No. 31 on Zhongshan Road and No. 87 on the Botanical Garden. That kind of barbecue stall, which has lobster and scallops, I suggest you don’t eat it, it’s more expensive** the only thing you can eat is vermicelli...

1258,1258,"Day 1: Take a 7 a.m. flight from Shanghai to Xiamen from Hongqiao. Because I chose Spring Airlines, I had to check in a 20-inch box. I didn’t buy checked luggage online in advance, so it was more expensive when I checked in. We arrived at the Hilton Hotel before 10 o'clock and had to wait until 3 pm to check in. The sea view room was arranged very well and met the initial requirements. The hotel is very close to Wanda Plaza, within 3 kilometers, you can ride there. Didi takes a taxi for 10 yuan. <br>The next day: Take a taxi to Wanshi Botanical Garden, 56 yuan. Tickets are 40 yuan. There are succulent pavilions, cactus pavilions, etc. Southern-style plants are worth visiting. One bus stop away is the west gate of Xiamen University. A very beautiful university, not only is it backed by Wulao Peak, adjacent to Nanputuo Temple, and facing the sea. I was fortunate enough to meet Lao Ji from the Living Map in Siyuan Valley, and listened to a university lecture, talking about the past events of Xiamen University, the architectural style of Xiamen University, and the emphasis on Chinese studies. After exiting the south gate, you will reach the Ring Island Road. You can ride a bicycle, watch the sea, and walk on the beach. The sea under the sunset is so beautiful. <br>Day 3: The hotel's reserved car will leave for the pier at 9:50 and take a cruise to Gulangyu Island. Gulangyu Island has architecture from all over the world and has a variety of charms. There are all kinds of exciting shops with beautiful layout and delicious taste. Zhang Sanfeng’s milk tea and Miss Zhao’s tea or cakes are indispensable. <br>Day 4: The graceful Jimei School Village has its own unique architecture. Hilton's service is excellent.

The location of the hotel is a bit remote, but the environment inside is pretty good and there is a free swimming pool. Unfortunately, we don’t have it🏊. The first day was wasted at the airport. <br>I slept until I woke up the next day. The weather in Xiamen was particularly sunny and the temperature was high. You must wear sunscreen and isolate yourself when going out. Rain will come from time to time in Xiamen. I remind everyone to have an umbrella in your bag in Xiamen. And sunscreen, Gulangyu Island is neither big nor small. Without a tour guide who is familiar with the terrain, you will really get lost. Along the way, you will listen to the tour guide introducing the island’s architecture and history. <br>The remaining two days were basically spent in the hotel. Because I had children with me, I couldn’t have much fun. The Sheraton Hotel deserves to be rated as a five-level hotel, with a very good service attitude and environment. <br>The taxi drivers in Xiamen are very enthusiastic.

Later, because my husband likes to be clean, he finally chose Choosing Hilton proved to be a wise move later in the trip. We stayed in an executive room on the 19th floor of the Hilton, and the view outside the window was really quite pleasant. The entire family trip was like a romantic vacation. Enjoyed it a lot. The hotel service is also good. When you take a taxi to the door, the waiter will give you a welcome message at the door. The service level is very good. The super large cookie that was given as a check-in gift when I checked in is also my son's favorite. He kept asking me if I could have more (for my little greedy cat). There are many buses available not far from the hotel. Eating, shopping, and visiting scenic spots are all fully satisfied.

Many attractions are not far away. The hotel is worthy of being a five-star hotel with all facilities. There is also a swimming pool for free use. The water is very clean. If you don’t want to go out to play, you can swim in the swimming pool which is also good. The gym, the breakfast buffet is also very rich, and the food is very good. I went to Gulangyu Island on the third day and stayed at the Gulangyu Garden Hotel in the evening. It was also very good. It is only a few minutes away from the beach and sunbathing. It is a good place to stay in Gulangyu Island where there is a lot of land. Such a good hotel is already very good. You can also go shopping nearby. Many shops are very unique and the snacks are delicious and not expensive. Finally, I would like to remind everyone to book tickets online in advance when going to Gulangyu Island. Gulangyu Island has a limit on the number of people. There was no way to go after the tickets were sold out. The only regret was that I couldn’t get in to Xiamen University.

I haven’t traveled much, but I feel like this free trip gave me a pretty good feeling. I didn’t do much research, just checking the routes and delicious food. Xiamen really doesn’t need a tour guide, it’s not necessary. And 5 days and 4 nights is really a lot of time, so you can have fun and have a good rest. Booked with Juneyao Airlines, the hotel is also very good, the service in the hotel is really good and considerate. Sheraton also has a free swimming pool and gym. If you like, you can bring a swimsuit, but it is a bit regretful that I did not try it this time. It is also very convenient to pick up and drop off from the airport in Xiamen. I stayed on the island for the first two days. Bai Tiao planned a route to go to scenic spots. In the evening, he could go to the beach. In the evening, he could go shopping in the commercial street. There are many snacks. In the next two days in Xiamen, we didn't plan the time well. We still didn't want to go to Xiamen University Baitiao. The access control was very strict. We didn't let you in through the south gate and took a detour to the west gate. As a result, it was so crowded that we didn't come back after 5 o'clock. The weather is too hot, and the Shaweipo Creative Park is very small. There are no people there during the day and it is not interesting. There are a few pretty good desserts nearby. If you are interested, you can try them. Then we went to Zengcuojian. There are a lot of snacks here. You can try them on an empty stomach. I think this place is fine for buying souvenirs. China Street is also good. <br>My personal summary is that when you go out to play, you need to have a good strategy, but you don't completely rely on the strategy to play. It is fun to combine work and rest.

This time, because the hotel on Gulangyu Island was not booked, we waited for more than half an hour. Fortunately, it was resolved and it was not too unpleasant. I stayed in Gulangyu Island for two nights, but it was actually too commercialized. Especially when it comes to meals, of the three meals, I was full at the last one, and couldn't eat the other two meals at all. After asking around, I found out that most of the businesses on the island sell high-quality seafood, which is estimated to be more than 100 per capita. It is still recommended to choose a big store with good online reviews. Our last meal cost more than 200 per person. The seafood was relatively fresh and tasted good. Generally speaking, it is recommended to go out of the island and into the city to eat seafood. Sheraton is the same everywhere, so there is nothing to say. I stayed in Gulangyu Island first and then Sheraton. I felt happy instantly. The sailing experience felt good. I went to Xiamen University at night, so I can’t comment.

It's really embarrassing. The location of this hotel is not very good.

Needless to say, the conditions are great. I really like the big bathtub...The breakfast buffet is also to my liking. I went to Xiamen University on the first day. I crossed the overpass from the hotel and took bus 87 to get there. I walked around and ate at Xiamen University (actually there is really no need to eat at Furong Restaurant, you can eat at other places, Furong is very crowded and not cheap...) and then directly out of Xiamen University is Baicheng Beach, where the water will be cooled at the end of December. Yes, it’s okay without the water-playing atmosphere. Then, after taking the bus for two more stops, I seem to have arrived at Zengcuo’an, which is a commercial street with a literary and artistic point. I have very little interest. Had some snacks.

The breakfast is also great and basically includes everything listed. Delicious food and great value for breakfast. Basically, our itinerary was very leisurely for the first two days. We checked out at noon on the third day and headed to the ferry terminal to Gulangyu Island. We were afraid that there would be too many people at the terminal and we would not be able to buy tickets, so we purchased online in advance. However, the ticket time determined during online purchase cannot be changed. , the boat departs every 20 minutes on-site. You can rest assured to buy tickets on-site instead of buying them in advance. The ferry ticket is a round trip and is valid for twenty days. There is no need to purchase another ticket for the return trip. However, staying in a villa hotel on the island is still a bit imperfect. It is quite far away from the center of the island. It's all on foot, which is easily overwhelming for the elderly. The surrounding restaurants are not very professional and the dishes are not complimentary.

The ticket was 35 per person and children were free. However, you had to bring your household registration book to exchange for the ticket. Adults only needed to show their ID cards.

The pick-up and drop-off guys are very punctual and will contact you in advance. They have a very good attitude. The hotel is said to be five-star. But I didn't feel it. The room was relatively small. One of the rooms we stayed in had a smell, but we were too lazy to change it, so we forgot about it. The shower in another room was broken. It was repaired quickly after being reported for repair. The water was very fast and the shower was very comfortable. The room was relatively clean and cozy, but a bit small. The waiters have a very good attitude and the security measures are very strict. You have to register every time you enter the hotel elevator. Due to the typhoon, the weather was relatively comfortable, but some attractions were not open. Gulangyu Island was also suspended for three days, so we had twists and turns when we went there, with sailings temporarily suspended and then resumed, but in the end we went. However, after arriving on the island, I felt that the scenery was not bad, but the commercial atmosphere was too strong. There are shops everywhere, and they use stamps to attract people. As a result, the purpose of children visiting Gulangyu Island is to get stamps. You have to walk the whole way on Gulangyu Island, there is no transportation, but the island is not big, so walking around is not very tiring. Xiamen University is only open to tourists from 12:00-14:00. Feel free to come in after 5pm. Due to the suspension of flights to Gulangyu Island, most tourists went to Xiamen University. There were so many people queuing up that I finally spent 30 yuan from a scalper to join the queue to get in. I just swiped my ID card to get in. The only restaurant open to the public at Xiamen University is Furong Restaurant. The food is expensive and not delicious. The Furong Tunnel is a special feature of Xiamen University. It is covered with student graffiti, which is quite nice to see. Baicheng Beach is also good, the sand is very fine and clean. It's nice to cycle along the seaside.",Postive
1272,1272,"First of all, the customer service is very good. I must give it a big thumbs up. No matter what questions I have, they will patiently answer them, including what to do and eat in Xiamen. I am very satisfied. The transportation to and from Xiamen is very convenient. Xiamen itself is very small, so it is very convenient to get to the airport no matter where you go. , and they also provided a free airport pick-up and drop-off. What I must say is that the complimentary airport pick-up and drop-off was very reliable and excellent. They contacted us one day in advance and came early the next day to wait. You don’t have to choose a five-star hotel for accommodation. The hotel service is great. Every day when you come in and out, you will be greeted thoughtfully, and your identity will be carefully verified when you enter. It is very safe. There is no free wifi problem as mentioned in the introduction. After receiving the room The card reception desk wrote the password directly on the card containing the room card. And one detail that must be mentioned is that the hotel waiter will thoughtfully put a postcard of Xiamen on the bed after cleaning the room every day. When it comes to eating the buffet breakfast at the product-included hotel, it is very rich. I am so full every day that I don’t feel hungry at noon. Moreover, the location of the hotel is relatively good. It is very close to Cafe Street and Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, so eating and nightlife are not a problem. It was midsummer when we went, and it was very hot, but we still had a lot of fun. Generally speaking, six days is enough for Xiamen, and even a little generous, so it is easier to play this way and not very tiring. It is a vacation. Take it easy, don't make it awkward. We are very satisfied with this product. No matter in terms of number of days or accommodation environment, we really have no choice. The price may be slightly higher than other products, but it is really worth the money. If you choose this product, you will definitely not regret. After arriving in Xiamen, you must buy a stamped book, because Gulangyu Island, Zengcuo'an, Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, Xiamen University, Huangcuo, these famous places have many shops with stamps, which can be regarded as souvenirs. , I think it is still very meaningful. As a patriot, I must mention that Xiamen is very close to the Kinmen Islands administered by Taiwan. It is so close that you can see each other's slogans with a telescope. It is worth seeing Gulangyu Island, Zengcuo'an, Xiamen University, and Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. , there are many Huangcuo Guides on the Internet, you can search for them yourself. The best one is of course Gulangyu Island which has just been successfully applied for World Heritage. The BRICS Conference will be held in Xiamen in a few days. They have re-paved the roads and they look very clean and beautiful. October and November should be the best time to visit.",Postive
1273,1273,"It was a very good trip. I received a text message to pick up the plane the day before departure. As soon as the plane landed, I received a text message from the pick-up man asking us to contact him when we got our luggage and tell us the license plate number. We were sent directly to the Pan Pacific Hotel. The hotel facilities are good and the breakfast has a lot of variety. My niece casually wrote on a piece of paper in the room that the signal was poor because of the poor network. When she came back from playing that day, she found that a router was installed in the room and she wrote down the password on the piece of paper. The service is really good! ! Let’s talk about the trip: It was already 7pm when we arrived at the hotel on the first day. I took two cars directly to Zhongshan Road. Tried the food there. There are oysters, scallops, peanut soup, etc. At around 10 o'clock, we took the bus back to the hotel and rested. After breakfast the next day, we set off to Nanputuo Temple around 8:30, and then had lunch at Xiamen University’s Furong Restaurant to experience university life, but the price was not too affordable. Exit Xiamen University through the tunnel and go to Huandao Road. Rented a bicycle and followed the Ring Road. I heard from the locals that there are sailboats. I searched it immediately and decided. Call someone to pick up the phone. It just takes a bit long. If you mind, you can call in advance. Due to the cold weather, I had to wear less clothes. I went back to the hotel to change my clothes and went to the Little Glasses Food Stall for dinner. Finally go back to the hotel to rest. Here is a reminder for everyone. The buses in Xiamen do not necessarily follow the same route back and forth, so you must pay attention carefully to avoid taking the wrong route. On the third day, we booked a 50-yuan luxury cruise to Gulangyu Island. Bought a package. I bought a ticket and went to the aquarium again. We ended up eating a lot of snacks. Take the boat back from Sanqiutian Pier. Tomorrow is the last day and I plan to sleep until I wake up naturally. Then go shopping in Zengcuo'an and then go to Zhongshan Road to buy some things in the afternoon! Overall this trip was pretty good!",Postive
1274,1274,"Overall, it was very good. I liked the accommodation and my family was also very satisfied. Because this was not my first time to Xiamen, I didn’t have a deep impression of the scenic spots. However, I was particularly impressed by the hotel. I felt it was very comfortable and I could have a good rest every day after having fun. In addition to the ok facilities, the hotel also has a suitable location. The only fly in the ointment is that I brought my swimming equipment, but when I arrived I found out that the indoor swimming pool was not open, which was a pity. <br>The Spring and Autumn flights were also on time and even arrived a little early when I went. Overall, I was very satisfied. <br>We also arranged round-trip pick-up and drop-off on the same trip. Because the plane took off and landed a little late, the pick-up and drop-off service was very timely. After leaving the airport, many people were queuing up to take a taxi. We just found the driver directly, which was very considerate. <br>Recommend this route. <br>However, going to Xiamen during the Spring Festival is really too crowded and there are too many people. You can go at other times. The locals say that the most fun time is March-April. The weather is good and there are not so many tourists. It is very suitable. .",Postive
1275,1275,"First of all, the private car transfer is very good, and it also provides free first-class airport access service for one person, although I have not experienced it. The return flight was delayed for 2 hours. Secondly, the location of Pan Pacific is quite good. There are buses just outside the door. It is very convenient to go everywhere. It is very close to the tanker terminal, only two stops away. However, the sound insulation is not very good. The design of the room is a bit strange. It is not very big. The bathroom is large, but the sink faucet is not good and leaks. Breakfast was good, but I didn't experience swimming or gym. There is also the Gulang Villa Hotel on Gulangyu Island. The sound insulation is very poor and I was woken up in the morning. The room size is okay, but the quilt smells of tide. This is understandable, after all, it is close to the seaside. The breakfast at the hotel is average, and the location is okay. It's not far from Neicuo'ao Pier, but if you want to eat snacks and buy souvenirs, you have to walk a long way. Because Gulangyu Island can only be visited by walking and the attractions are expensive, so I didn’t go there. Third, I want to talk about this travel experience. Xiamen is really suitable for independent travel. It is not very big, the seaside is beautiful, and Xiamen University is also beautiful, but you have to queue up and it is only open during the holidays. When I went to Xiamen University, I felt that I should have studied seriously. Needless to say, Gulangyu Island is very good. I really like the houses on the island, the wind on the beach and the sound of waves. The package also includes the Ice and Snow World and sailing out to sea. This is the most tiring part of this trip. I suggest you consider this package because the Ice and Snow World is very small, and taking photos slowly takes up to 20 minutes, which is amazing. . There is also the sailing boat that went out to sea. After struggling for a long time, it still didn't go. At first, it was said that it would require a health inspection and not to go out to sea. Then it was said that it was okay. Within 10 minutes after going, it was too windy and it didn't go. So the time was changed. I don’t want to go, I’m really speechless. Moreover, the Ice and Snow World and the sailing trip are not together. You have to walk more than 1 kilometer by bus. The taxi fare is about the starting price. There is a bus at the entrance of the Ice and Snow World, so I didn’t want to take a taxi. Very speechless anyway. Therefore, you still need to consider this package, because going overseas is affected by many factors and there are uncontrollable factors, so you should go as soon as you want. Finally, let’s talk about customer service. They are all very good. Wang Jing from Changzhou is very patient. I don’t know if she is annoyed by me. The one in Xiamen was also very good, reminding me to buy tanker tickets early. There was also a travel butler who was also very good. He helped me deal with the sailing trip until about 10 o'clock in the evening. In the end, even though I didn’t go, I was given a subsidy and was very patient. That's why I couldn't arrange the tickets in the package earlier so that I could go on the first day. I still contacted the travel manager after urging several times, which I wasn't very satisfied with. But overall the customer service of the three is still very good. That’s all. Next time I have a chance, I will go to Xiamen to enjoy the sea breeze and relax.",Postive
1276,1276,"Let me talk about the overall feeling first. Overall, it is good. The hotel is comfortable. I have upgraded to a sea view and city view room, and I can see the whole view of Xiamen. I am very satisfied with the hotel service facilities. The only drawback is that the return flight is late. It took more than two hours, but Tongcheng also sent a text message reminder in time. This is still good, very accurate! <br>The advantage of free travel is that you don’t have to rush for time. You can wake up naturally every day, look at the sea view, and have a hotel buffet. There are Chinese and Western styles with many varieties to meet the needs of different people. Moreover, the hotel management is in place and the staff is of high quality. No matter where I meet, I will take the initiative to say hello. It's hot in the afternoon and I don't want to go out, so I exercise and swim in the hotel, which is very comfortable. <br>Xiamen University, South Putuo, and Baicheng Beach can be used as the same route because they are relatively close and there are many people on the beach. There are also sellers of coconuts and sand digging tools. Although the heat wave is rolling, it cannot stop people's enthusiasm, especially children. I like digging in the sand and looking for shells. My son also caught two live hermit crabs, haha, I was so happy! <br>Gulangyu Island is also better than going there. Buy the round-trip ferry tickets online in advance, and when you get to the guide, buy the tickets according to where you want to go. This way you have more choices...<br>No more words, just look at the pictures.",Postive
1277,1277,"Generally speaking, this trip to Xiamen was quite satisfactory. I had arranged the incoming and outgoing flights before the trip, and I could freely choose the time. It was well arranged. It was raining lightly these days when I went to Xiamen, but... It won’t affect our visits to various attractions. On the first day, I went to Gulangyu Pier. It was still a long way from the Hilton Hotel where I was staying. Before going, I checked the route and took the bus. It took a long time, so I chose Didi Private Car, which was very fast. It takes about 20 minutes. The bus fare is not expensive after using the coupon. I bought the ferry ticket in advance on ** and it was very convenient. I just swiped my ID card when I went there. When I came back, I swiped my ID card directly. I was too tired from walking on the island. On the second day, we went to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, which was also very fun. On the third day, we went to Hulishan Fort and Xiamen University. All in all, everything was just right.",Postive
1278,1278,"After getting off the plane, I didn't expect it to be so hot. I suddenly felt that summer was terrible. Fortunately, the pick-up man was on time and we arrived at the hotel quickly. <br>It was my first time staying at the Hilton and I was curious about everything. I wandered around the swimming pool and gym. The service was really great, and it felt very unfamiliar to me. When I finally checked out, I asked if I could keep the room card, which can be regarded as a small souvenir. <br>The highlight of visiting Xiamen is definitely eating and playing. The online guides are very detailed. I won’t repeat them. I will briefly talk about some of our experiences. First of all, it is best to try all the snacks recommended on the Internet. You will definitely There are a lot of harvests, such as sea squid, one portion is very satisfying for two people, delicious and cost-effective; there are many oyster sellers on Zhongshan Road that are very good. Don’t buy the oysters that cost 10 yuan for 10 pieces on the Taiwanese snack street. The boss said they are local No matter how much garlic you add, you can’t get rid of the strange smell; it depends on everyone’s preference, I like it very much. For the most delicious one, I recommend Master Wang’s Stinky Tofu on Zhongshan Road. This store is also recommended online. When I found it, I thought the tofu was average. As for seafood, the ones recommended online should be similar. I only went to eat the small squid and small eyes at the food stall called Big Eyes, even though the actual price was higher than the price in the guide. It’s a bit high, but it’s still suitable and the taste is reliable. <br>As for the play guide, I will add that after going to Xiamen University and Putuo Temple, Cat Street is still worth a visit, especially for friends who love cats or small animals, the Cat Museum store is open every night at 7.30 (note: Not sure) There will be a limited number of tickets sold to stay in the cat train with some cats. It looks very interesting and not expensive. It seems to be in the small dozens. However, we were exhausted after playing for a day, so we chose to go back and rest. If you want to go up to Gulangyu Island by yourself, you can follow the routes provided on Baidu Map. I took a look and they are all very good. We chose a road that goes along the east coast. There were very few people in that section at first. It is suitable for taking pictures. There are more and more people near Sunlight Rock. In the second half of the coastal road, there are almost no people on the road. There are also some small beaches with very few people. Take pictures along the way. However, the route we took will miss some popular shopping streets. Some of the small shops on the street look pretty good in other people’s photos. If you have enough energy, you can plan and turn around and take a stroll. We are exhausted. Just didn’t go.",Postive
1279,1279,"The overall trip was quite satisfactory, and the service provided by Tongcheng Travel Consultant was excellent! On July 30, we caught up with the typhoon in Xiamen and failed to escape. The travel consultant was able to actively contact customer service after 10 o'clock in the evening to resolve air ticket changes and hotel check-out matters. I flew to Xiamen on the morning of the 31st and was taken to the hotel by a special car. I stored my luggage and then took a taxi to Nan Putuo to hike in the rain. Since it was raining heavily, we didn’t climb to the top of the mountain, so we had lunch nearby after descending. Since we were all eating meat but not having fun together, we didn’t try Nan Putuo’s special vegetables! I was originally going to visit Xiamen University, but even though it was raining, the long queue to visit Xiamen University was still very far away! In the afternoon, I went back to the hotel to check in. Since it was not far from the beach, I went out to the beach for a while in the evening, but it rained again! In particular, it is very convenient to use Didi taxis in Xiamen, and the Didi drivers are also very satisfied with their services. The next day was the most satisfying day of our trip. We took a Didi taxi to Zengcuo'an. As soon as we entered Zengcuo'an, there were all kinds of delicacies, including delicious seafood barbecue, fresh fruits, and various kinds of food. Specialty snacks. If you buy Xiamen specialties, the store will directly package them and deliver them to your home for free, which saves trouble and is convenient. After spending most of the day shopping in Zengcuo'an, it was quite pleasant to go for a walk on the beach. In the evening, we took a taxi to Zhongshan Road Commercial Street to enjoy various food and shopping. I went to Gulangyu Island on the last day. I got up early to check out and stored my luggage at the hotel. The front desk also helped pack breakfast. It is recommended to follow the Xiamen Ferry Company on ** to purchase ferry tickets. Due to account issues, I bought them online, and a 30 yuan handling fee was added to each ticket, which is quite shameful! There were a lot of people on the ferry, so we got a private room for 15 yuan per person and drinks. After arriving on the island, we walked for a while and got on the sightseeing bus. Since it just opened after the typhoon, there are still many people. We still play in the sand with our children here. If you arrange accommodation on Gulangyu Island, I heard that the night view is very beautiful. Since we had to catch a flight in the evening, we took the ferry back to Xiamen at around two o'clock in the afternoon. There were so many people on the return ferry! In the afternoon, someone was sent to the airport. After arriving at the airport, a service staff member took us directly to the check-in window. The flight back in the evening was delayed for several hours due to weather, so I was very satisfied with the overall service! The hotel environment is also very good, and travel is basically handled by Didi. Every time we have a six-seat business trip, we can reach Xiamen for 70 to 80 yuan. Tongcheng’s service consultants are awesome! Since the photos are all in the camera, find a few attached photos on your phone.",Postive
1280,1280,"Xiamen was very beautiful in my mind before, especially its Gulangyu Island. This time, my best friend and I finally set foot on Xiamen. Since we had an evening flight, we sat in the car going to the hotel and looked out the window at the Xiamen night street scene, which I thought was okay. Especially when I saw the neon-lit Gulangyu Island on the opposite side of the ferry, I felt a little excited. Early the next morning, the weather was particularly good, with blue sky and white clouds, the sun was not too strong, and there was a slight sea breeze. Taking the printed travel notes from netizens, we started our trip to Xiamen. When we arrived at the ""famous"" snack bar on Zhongshan Road, Huang Zehe, we put down our quilts, ordered something crazy, and prepared to have a feast. But when I took the first sip of peanut soup, I was knocked unconscious. It was so sweet. The brown rice is not tasty either, it just has a lot of fat in it, and the glutinous rice feels very oily in your mouth. I didn't want to eat the leek box after taking one bite. I didn't know what it tasted like. I really don’t know how this Huang Zehe became famous. In our Chengdu, it can only be made by country people who just came to the city to do small business. <br>It doesn’t matter if we didn’t have a good breakfast, our main purpose is to have fun. After the ferry, we boarded the sightseeing boat with a 10 yuan ticket recommended by netizens and prepared to go to the long-awaited Gulangyu Island. However, when I was sitting on the boat and saw seaweed, foam, plastic bags, broken shoes and other garbage floating everywhere on the sea surface of the ferry terminal, I immediately started to have some ideas about Xiamen's urban management. But I thought it might be understandable that there are more piers in the center of the city. The sea should be better when we get to Gulangyu Island. The boat took us around Gulangyu Island, looking at the sea and sky in the distance, blowing the sea breeze, and feeling pretty good. Stepping onto the pier of Gulangyu Island and being surrounded by local tour guides soliciting tourists, we finally entered Gulangyu Island. In order to experience the folk customs, we walked into the residential area. The streets here are very narrow. Most of the houses seem to be relatively small and the doors are very close to each other, facing the street. The residential buildings are also new and old, and there seems to be no unified planning, no reflection of their own residential characteristics or style, and they are messy and disorganized. In our Chengdu, not to mention the tourist attractions (such as the famous farmhouse Hongsha Village, Happy Plum Grove, etc.), the rural houses on both sides of the highway have been uniformly transformed into Western Sichuan folk style.

1281,1281,"Departing on May 1st, we separated the long vacation from the sand and dust of Beijing. We arrived at Xiamen Gaoqi Airport at around 8 o'clock in the evening and took a taxi directly to the hotel. It cost about 40 yuan to take a taxi directly to the hotel for check-in. I was happy because I asked before that I would try my best. The customer service staff who arranged a double bed on the same trip said that there were no double beds and only standard rooms. Until the hotel found out that the double bed was arranged, I was very satisfied...<br> After the next day, I took a car to the ferry terminal not far away and bought a ticket...waited...to get on the boat. ...The ferry ticket to Gulangyu Island can be purchased directly at the self-service machine. It is very convenient. Just choose the pier. The round trip costs 35 yuan. The most things on the island are selling various cakes and tea. It is recommended to buy less. The environment on the island is still good. I’m tired from walking all day. ** It’s directly ranked No. 1 in sports. Snacks are available. I had rice rolls, Lin-style fish balls, octopus feet sauce, pig’s feet, Zhang San crazy milk tea, and I had to wait in line for a long time for many orders. Later I found out that there are many shops. More than one store suggested that you don’t have to rush and go shopping slowly.

I waited for an hour before taking a taxi back to the hotel<br> Third Xiamen University, where I went that day, was not allowed to enter the school until 12 o'clock. I waited for an hour and bought two cups of milk tea. I took my time and was not in a hurry. After I came out of the school, I took the cable car. Personally, I felt that the cable car was not exciting. Maybe it was because I walked too much on Gulangyu Island that day. I want to go back early to rest and then go out to find something to eat in the evening<br> On the fourth day, I went to Zeng Cuo'an and personally thought it was quite good snacks. There were many snacks. My husband loves mangoes, so it was a wish. I also ate various seafood, which was pretty good, and I didn't charge too much.

1282,1282,"High marks are entirely given to Tongcheng. I have to say that the customer service is really good. Even if the phone was shut down during the trip, even if I was worried that I would not be able to pick up at the airport, they would find a way to contact me. The flight there went smoothly, but the flight was delayed by 4 hours when we came back, which was a bit of a delay. There is a BRICS conference in Xiamen, and the hotel is quite strict. I went early on the first day, and the Pan Pacific room was not cleaned. There was only one room, and I opened one. I wanted to take a shower, and people who hadn’t registered in that room were not cleaned. To enter the room, ID is required everywhere. I went to Zhongshan Road and mainly ate some snacks, but there wasn’t much to buy. The prices were relatively high. Buses and shared bicycles were very convenient, but it was too hot to ride. There are really many people going to Gulangyu Island. If you are not pressed for time, it is best to stay on the island for two more days. You can only walk on the island, which is more time-consuming, so it is better to take a leisurely stroll. If you rush too much, it will be boring. Food on the island is relatively expensive, and the souvenirs are not cheap. The Sea Garden Hotel where I stayed is closer to Sanqiutian Port, and the road is gentle. If you stay in this hotel, it is best to get off the boat at Sanqiutian Pier. There are also many commercial streets. The shops on the island are all private, and the service in some shops is really not that good. I was traveling with an elderly person and had luggage. I wanted a hotel electric car to pick me up. There was an electric car, but I was told there was no electric car. I said there were no electric cars. I thought we were booking on the same journey and not directly at the hotel. They said we would not pick up the car. I said I would pay. It also said there was no pick-up or drop-off. The Upside Down House is even more deceptive. Tongcheng said it was free for seniors over 70 years old. When I went there, I was asked to buy half the ticket. They said it said free. You asked Tongcheng to waive it, and we couldn't avoid it. I just go out to have fun, and it makes me really unhappy to hear such a talkative southern man say such things. I went to picky eaters for dinner. The price was okay and affordable, but northerners do eat better than southerners. The three of us ate all the dishes we ordered. I also went to the Yongding Earth Building where Big Fish and Begonia was filmed. I would like to remind everyone that when I went there, some people said that the 50 yuan fee for a tour guide was not necessary. There was nothing good to hear. It was better to go shopping by yourself. Moreover, it was for selling tea, and the price was very high. , not as cheap as stalls in earth buildings. There is a bus to Tulou, but time is too tight, so we hired a taxi. The driver was nice and enthusiastic. I left the driver's phone number so that he can provide it if needed in the future.",Postive
1283,1283,"Thanks to Tongcheng for recommending the free travel route. I am very satisfied with the hotel arrangement. The hotel has a nice sea view room facing Gulangyu Island. The hotel is close to Zhongshan Road and is very convenient for traveling. I woke up in the morning and went to the 4th floor of the hotel facing the sea view. I slowly ate the buffet breakfast and looked at Gulangyu Island opposite and the meeting ships and warships in the sea. I felt very comfortable. There is also a free airport pick-up service on the same journey. The only regret is that the hotel does not have a swimming pool. <br>Let’s talk about the planning of this trip. <br>One, route<br>day1: Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, nearby seaside night view<br> After arriving in Xiamen, you will be picked up and transferred to the hotel. In the evening, you can go to Zhongshan Road where there are many delicious foods. We ate Jinjiagang flavor which is popular on Zhongshan Road. Ranked first and the price is also very good. <br>Day2: Gulangyu Island:<br> To go to Gulangyu Island, you need to buy a boat ticket in advance for 35 yuan per person. There are two ways: ** and online. **Tickets can be purchased starting at 5 a.m. on the same day. Tickets cannot be purchased online on the day and must be purchased in advance. After buying the ticket, you can directly swipe your ID card to get on the boat. It is recommended to arrive at the Yamamoto Pier. There are many attractions nearby. It is recommended to go to Gulangyu Island for snacks. The rice rolls there are pretty good. Going to a hotel to eat is a scam. The seafood at my grandma’s private restaurant I went to was much more expensive than outside. We ordered carefully enough to ask the price of each dish. It feels 20 to 30 per pound more expensive than outside. Considering that transportation within Gulangyu Island is not easy, I understand that I should relax my vigilance. As a result, it started to rip off tourists. I ordered sea mushrooms, which were estimated to cost 30 per catty, but he bought them for 168 per catty. A plate of sea mushrooms cost 392 yuan. Businesses can really do it. When I checked out, I said why didn't you ask clearly? It was really annoying. Everyone, don’t be fooled. We had dinner at a restaurant called Weiyou near the hotel. This restaurant was absolutely delicious, with a good price and good environment. Highly recommended 👍. <br>Day3: Xiamen University, Zengcuo'an, Nanputuo Temple, one country, two systems beach, sailing boat out to sea. <br> Get up at 8 o'clock in the morning and play at Nanputuo Temple. Go to the beach at 10 o'clock to go sailing. Adults cost 178 yuan per person, and children under 1.2 meters tall cost 60 yuan per person. Absolutely stimulating. It’s great to see Kinmen and Kinmen facing Taiwan from the sea. Bring sunscreen when you rest. The journey lasts 1 hour. At noon, you can eat, stroll and rest in Zengcuo'an. You can line up to enter Xiamen University until 5:30 in the evening. Dinner can be arranged near Xiamen University. When the sun goes down in the evening, you can go to the beach of ""One Country, Two Systems"" or the beach at Xiamen University. We went to the one country, two systems beach. The beach there is larger. It is a natural beach. Pay attention to safety when visiting the beach. For late night snacks, it’s a good idea to choose the Internet celebrity’s small-eye food stalls. Highly recommended👍<br>Day 4: I got up at 5 o'clock in the morning and rode a small yellow car along the coast. It was nice to enjoy the beautiful morning, the beautiful sea view, and breathe the air that took away the sea breeze. If you ride far, take a taxi back to the hotel. Take a shower and go to the fourth floor to enjoy breakfast with a beautiful sea view. At noon, you can eat and buy some gifts on Zhongshan Road. Get ready to go home.",Postive
1284,1284,"The departure plane was picked up on time and very timely. The first stop was Gulangyu. The pick-up was only for delivery to the pier. You had to take a boat to the hotel yourself. There were hotel signs all the way to the island. It was quick and easy to find. Check-in at 14 o'clock. Go early. You can store your luggage in the hotel and go out for a walk. The hotel has free shuttle service at 15:30. The facilities at Gulangyu Villa Hotel are relatively good, but you must bring mosquito repellent because there are many small flying insects. The toilet water provided by the hotel is not very effective. Gulangyu Island can be visited in one day. I personally feel that staying in Gulangyu Island for two days is a waste of time. There are not many snacks in Gulangyu Island. When eating seafood, it is recommended to choose the restaurants next to the hotel because they are all the same and you will be short of something. , the second stop in Xiamen, the Sheraton Hotel is said to be a five-star hotel, but it really doesn't feel that good. The living area of ​​the room is small, there is no vent, and it is completely enclosed. There is an elementary school downstairs. The elementary school broadcasts are noisy, and the hotel check-in process is very complicated. It's slow. The hotel is in a remote location and far away from all tourist attractions. It is recommended to take public transportation when going out. Xiamen's public transportation is relatively convenient, but forget it for those who suffer from motion sickness. Eat! There is a Hong Kong-style tea restaurant on the 3rd floor of the hotel. It is recommended to buy a group purchase. Going to Zhongshan Road is not interesting. It is not as good as Gulangyu. The atmosphere is too commercial and there are not many snacks. It is recommended to go to Zengcuo'an directly. It is also relatively close to Xiamen University and has a beach. I checked out at 12 o'clock on the day I came back. When I picked up the airport, I was told that I could only pick up people at the hotel at 18 o'clock. I was really helpless. I might as well go to the airport by myself. The public transportation is very convenient. It is unreal that the plane is delayed by 2 hours. happy! Tongcheng's customer service service is average, not as considerate as everyone commented, but I would like to thank my customer service for helping me with the travel guide. Although it was useless, on my fourth day in Xiamen, Tongcheng sent me a message telling me to stay at home. rest! Let me say something! That’s all I can think of for now, I wish my friends a happy trip!",Postive
1285,1285,"For the first trip of the new year, I chose to travel on the same journey. After the plane landed safely, the driver picked us up on time. We arrived at the hotel to rest for a while and started our journey. Sun, waves, sand. There is also the big banyan tree that I love. The morning on Gulangyu Island starts with passion fruit. Avoid the noisy crowds. Stop and go in the alleys. Look up at the ray of sunshine hanging from the roots of the big banyan tree. Take a mango flower and look at the old buildings everywhere. The flowers peeking out from the middle make my mood become beautiful. On the third day, I came to the beautiful Xiamen University campus. I don’t know why I couldn’t resist this kind of ancient building. It was love that penetrated deep into my bones. Furong Tunnel also contains our youth and dreams. I can't help but continue to dig on the beach, and read the newly bought novels while blowing the sea breeze. The years are quiet and I am at peace. On the last day, after finishing the buffet at the hotel, the driver took us to the airport on time. Unfortunately, the flight was delayed, so I was bored and wanted to share Xiamen's delicious food with everyone. [Naughty] The legendary Xiamen is a paradise for foodies. Of course, all kinds of tropical fruits are indispensable. Passion fruit is the standard every day. Custard apple is really sweet, as sweet as first love. [Laughing] Although this mango flower is beautiful, it is not as sweet as imagined. There are all kinds of beautiful things in various literary and artistic shops🍦. Of course, seafood is indispensable in a coastal city. Big yellow snails and red flower crabs will satisfy your taste buds instantly. There are countless kinds of Internet celebrity snacks. Ye's mochi is sweet and glutinous, the egg filling is fresh and delicious, and the bamboo shoot jelly that I mustered up the courage to eat is unexpectedly delicious... In short, it was a pleasant experience The location of the hotel is very convenient for traveling. It is a ten-minute walk from the pier. There are buses to various attractions. The hotel staff are also very friendly. Next time you travel, you’ll want to choose Tongcheng.",Postive
1286,1286,"It was a well-planned trip with my friends. I imagined all kinds of things in Xiamen on the plane. After a while, I was really attracted by the beauty of Xiamen. As soon as the plane arrived, the driver who picked me up called me on time and told me in detail which exit to meet at. The service was very good. The Pan Pacific Hotel where we stayed is located in the center of the city. It is not far from the pier and Zhongshan Road. It costs more than 10 yuan to take a taxi. The accommodation environment is good, the waiters are proactive and enthusiastic, our room is facing the sun, there is plenty of sunshine, and the hotel has a rich breakfast. The various types of food are quite complete. Stayed for three nights in total. On the fourth night, we came to the beautiful Gulangyu Island and stayed at the Pannuo Impression Hotel. It is a themed hotel with different rooms. The Cowboy House we stayed in was very good. I liked the modern and simple decoration style of the room and corridor, which is full of personality. The service is also good, the only thing is that there is no elevator, so the waiter needs to help carry the luggage. All in all a good trip.",Postive

Eat<br> The place where I stayed was the Sheraton, which is worthy of its five-star title. The double room is very spacious, and several people traveling together can play in the same room. The breakfast is so good that it can be counted as a meal. It’s a feast, and there’s a lot of variety. The hotel has its own swimming pool and gym. Although it is a bit small, it can meet the needs of different people. It also provides many additional services and is very attentive. On the fourth night, we stayed at the Gulangyu Villa Hotel. It should be the best on Gulangyu Island and made our stay very comfortable. The accommodation should be given full marks. <br> Traveling is very convenient. There are many taxis on the island, and the fare is not expensive, much cheaper than in Shanghai. However, the phenomenon of taxi scalpers in Xiamen is serious. They do not sell different tickets, so don’t be fooled easily. Gulangyu Island is all on foot, so you can feel the atmosphere. <br> I have visited many places, and except for the feeling that Guanyin Mountain was cheated, the trip was worthwhile. The tranquility of Nanputuo, the atmosphere of Xiamen University, the leisure of Gulangyu Island, and the magnificence of Sunlight Rock are all worth visiting. <br> Of course eating is the most important thing when you arrive in Xiamen! I ate at many famous restaurants on the island, such as Tangyan, Zuodao, Xiaoyan, etc., and they all tasted good. The most recommended one on Gulangyu Island is Private Kitchen No. 35. The fish inside is really delicious. Other times, I ate some snacks from food stalls. I bought Miss Zhao's pie, Huang Yuantang's pineapple cake, etc. on Gulangyu Island. I always buy something when I go out to play<br> I was very lucky. It was originally said to rain in five days, but it only rained in two days. <br> Finally, I would like to give a special thumbs up to customer service Xu Dandan! ! ! She is extremely patient. When booking, she was in trouble due to some special circumstances, but she still solved it patiently. She understands the hearts of young people like us. She works very seriously and responsibly.

Friends who want to eat seafood, it is best to find a food stall or something. After checking in at noon, go out to eat. A meal costs more than 800, and it's not delicious. It's better to find food stalls or something, or check out ** group purchases, and the self-service seafood is relatively cost-effective. You can go to Zhongshan Road to have fun. Zengcuo'an is also pretty good, with a snack street that's crowded. Don’t buy rose cakes or anything like that, it’s not delicious. Personally I don’t think Taiwanese mochi is that good either. It’s suitable for people with sweet and sour tastes. I like spicy food and I don’t eat much here. 😂 If you want to buy mango or something, it’s best to Fortunately, I bought it in Xiamen. There is no mango store on Gulangyu Pedestrian Island. Gulangyu is basically just for fun. So, listen to me, if you want to buy specialties for your friends and family, it’s best to buy them in Xiamen. Gulangyu’s seven-year-old rose caramel tea is also available. Yes, it tastes good.

1290,1290,"We arrived in Xiamen in the afternoon after the typhoon. After a short break at the hotel, we wandered around Wanda Plaza and had dinner. Then begins two relatively cool days. On the first day, we visited Nanputuo, Xiamen University, Baicheng Beach, and Huli Mountain Fort. In the afternoon, we took a sailboat at Wuliyuan Pier to experience the most unforgettable experience. In the evening, enjoy various snacks on Zengcuo'an Zhongshan Road. To be honest, Xiamen’s snacks are full of characteristics, but they are not very popular among Tianjin people. The next morning we went to Guanyin Landscape World to play. The facilities were terrible and I don’t recommend that you go! In the afternoon, we took a boat to Gulangyu Island and enjoyed the beautiful scenery of Sunlight Rock in the evening. There are a dazzling array of literary and artistic shops. Children like to take their notebooks and stamp their stamps in each shop. It is full of fun and a good souvenir. The weather got hotter on the third day, and the sun in Xiamen was so damaging that sunscreen almost lost its significance. My skin was tanned and stinging, so I decided to go back to the hotel to escape the heat in the afternoon. The service quality of the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel has nothing to say and I am very satisfied. However, it is far from most scenic spots and the cost of taking a taxi back and forth every day is relatively high. One last thing to emphasize is that the outbound and return flights were delayed by 4 hours and 3 hours respectively, which was really frustrating, but the airport pick-up and drop-off service arranged for the same trip was super on time.

The service of the hotel is also very good. There is an open-air swimming pool for parents and children. It’s just me and my baby at night. Is there a private pool available? At night, I lay on the open-air lounge chair in the hotel and counted the stars with my baby, and watched the planes flying overhead. It was a scene from a Korean drama! As for tourist attractions, Gulangyu Island is a popular place for artistic young people to show off, and the seafood on the island is relatively expensive. Tsang Cuo An is a good place to eat seafood. 10 oysters are 10 yuan, 7 skewers of grilled squid are 10 yuan, and Australian dragons are 100 yuan each. Those who like seafood are in luck. The internet celebrity Xiao Glasses Seafood Food Stall is indeed delicious and cheap. It is a five-star recommendation. Another thing I want to tell you is that if you have the budget, I still recommend this hotel. The location is good. There is the No. 87 bus station downstairs, 2 stops to Xiagu Pier, direct buses to Zengcuo'an and Xiaoyan, and Zhongshan Road. Walk a few steps from the pedestrian street to 135.",Postive
2028,2028,"It was a pretty smooth short trip. The pictures were found on ** but they are basically the same as the actual stay. Picture 1-2 is the Pannuo Holiday Hotel on Gulangyu Island.

The 5 days and 4 nights, excluding the first and last three days, are actually enough for Xiamen<br>The package of hotel and air tickets before traveling A customer service call came to confirm the information. I originally planned to stay in Gulangyu Island for the last night, but the return ticket was too early. I was afraid that there would be no ferry, so I changed it to Gulangyu Island for the first night. After that, the customer service was ok and sent me a group departure notice. There was a small episode in the middle, but the travel consultant Yu Xiaomin helped solve the problem. I thought Yu was very nice and patient, but I didn’t like it when he urged me to leave a review.<br>Before departure, the hotel in Gulangyu Island and the pick-up crew both sent text messages and phone calls to someone to pick up the plane after we got off the plane. This was great and we The departure time was at 12 o'clock in the evening. The pick-up staff was also very helpful. We took the ferry directly to Gulangyu Island. After arriving on the island, the hotel staff also came to pick us up. We took the boxes as soon as we met. The first night I stayed at the Pannuo Holiday Hotel, which is close to Neicuoao. The pier is very close and just opposite. But we took the evening ferry from another pier. Fortunately, a hotel came to pick us up. Otherwise, it would be a bit scary for two people to be on the island in the early morning<br>btw Is the ferry 30 round trip for one person? ? Oh my God, I can’t remember... It’s only been a few days... Wechat and follow Xiamen Ferry Co., Ltd. You can check the schedule ➕Buy tickets, but the evening ferry can be bought directly on site without online tickets<br>The next few nights are general The Pacific Room is on the 18th floor. I like it. It has a small refrigerator and a bathtub. The buffet breakfast is also very good. Auntie comes and cleans it every day. It's a pity that we didn't book a double bed room, so we put the beds in the standard room together to sleep every night<br> Hotel There is a bus at the door. It is very convenient. We only took two taxis. Otherwise, we took the bus. You have to look at the direction clearly. Don’t sit on the wrong side. Don’t ask me how I know...<br>PS Let me tell you something. We will go to Huandao Road the next day. I was tricked by a taxi driver and took a sailing boat for 178 yuan per person. I just saw the waves and nothing else. I thought it was a scam. I don’t recommend going. I shouldn’t stop being fooled by others. I should stick to the place I originally wanted to go. Koi milk tea is delicious at SM Plaza. Oh, I made my own guide and visited many scenic spots, including South Putuo Xiamen University Botanical Garden, SM Square, Huandao Road, Shapowei Huangcuo Beach, etc. If you want to consult, you can also message me privately<br>ps. Let me say that our trip from 12.14 to 12.18 was not as expected. It's warm... The wind on Gulangyu Island is quite strong, so I suggest you wear a sweatshirt and jacket and remember to bring slippers.",Postive
2029,2029,"The flight on the first day was supposed to be at 7:30, but it was delayed until 8:45 before I boarded the plane and arrived at T4 in Xiamen at 11 o'clock. It was super unpleasant! I called a ride on Didi and waited for 10 minutes. The driver deliberately delayed the ride and refused to pick me up. We called a second car and this time they didn’t refuse the ride but took us on a detour to the hotel and it cost us almost 80 yuan. Hey, there’s no way to bully us out-of-towners! We arrived at the hotel at almost 12 o'clock. They had a good attitude. They just promised to help us with the wireless network. However, we had to go to the mailbox and couldn't do it. When we went back the next night, we ran to ask the front desk clerk to do it again. Let's talk about the hotel's cleaning service. The service on the first and second days was okay, but on the third day it was very lazy. The hotel's breakfast is pretty good with lots of variety and good taste. There is a bus stop downstairs from the hotel. There are buses going to several tourist attractions downstairs, but they only leave every 20 minutes and it's a bit difficult to wait. Maybe it’s because Wuhan’s public transportation is so developed that there is a bus every 2.3 minutes. The buses are big and new. The buses here can only be considered minibuses in Wuhan. The buses here are small, slow and have poor air conditioning. There is no other advantage besides being cheap. The hotel is very close to Xiagu Pier, a 15-minute walk. After staying in Xiamen for three days, we did all the things that we should not do in this city. Overall, it's good. I probably won't come back in the near future. The tourist atmosphere is too heavy.",Postive
2030,2030,"We went during the National Day and the price was a little more expensive, but since we were traveling with children, it was more suitable to travel independently, so this route was very suitable for our actual situation. Depart from Nanjing, arrive at Xiamen T4 International Airport, and then take a taxi directly to the Pan Pacific Hotel. The toll is about 58 yuan. After checking into the hotel, I am very satisfied with the hotel's environment and service. It is worthy of being a five-star hotel. Take a rest in the hotel After that, we went directly to Zhongshan Road for some shopping. After exiting the hotel door, we turned right. There was a bus stop about 20 meters away. Since we went there on the 30th, there were not many people (passing there in the next few days, the people were simply... densely packed), bought some specialties and had a bowl of tea and noodles. <br>The breakfast at the hotel the next day was very good, including fruits, pastries, pasta, milk, etc. After that, we walked directly to the Xiamen International Cruise Terminal and took a boat to Gulangyu Island for a day trip. Remember to buy some. For tickets to Sanqiutian Pier, there are some options from Neicuoao Pier to Longtou Road. ""Tai Mang Le"" recommends everyone to have a drink, it is really good. <br>On the third day, I took bus 135 to visit Xiamen University. I would like to remind everyone to get off at Xiamen University Xicun Station, then cross an overpass, and you can see the gate of Xiamen University. <br>On the fourth day, I went to Zengcuo’an for a day trip. Basically, there were snacks, and there were many kinds. <br>Return home on the fifth day. <br>To summarize this trip, it was very relaxing and comfortable. The hotel was also great. It is very suitable for traveling with children. Xiamen is worth a visit, a beautiful coastal city.",Postive
2031,2031,"The hotel I chose for this five-day trip to Xiamen was Pan Pacific. The hotel's service and location are highly recommended. There is a bus station just outside the door, and there are direct buses to the scenic spots - No. 87. It's only two stops away from Xiagu Pier, and it only takes 7 minutes by taxi, which is super convenient. It seems that Gulangyu Island will be applied for World Heritage status in October. The number of people on the island is limited and it is very difficult to buy ferry tickets. Therefore, for those who want to go to Xiamen in October, it is recommended to purchase ferry tickets online in advance, otherwise you will regret not being able to get to the island. (I personally feel that staying in Xiamen for the five-day tour is a bit of a waste of time. It is recommended that the five-day independent trip of the same journey arrange 1-2 days in Gulangyu Island.) If only one day is arranged on Gulangyu Island, I think the total itinerary of 3-4 days is enough. Xiamen is not big and has few major attractions. The Botanical Garden is the most worth visiting. When it comes to food, I personally think that in addition to trying snacks, it is more reliable to choose big restaurants for dinner. At least they will not rip off customers and can guarantee the quality. There is nothing to say about Tongcheng’s service, just two words: very good! Very considerate! I would like to thank my consultant Tianjiao for always patiently helping me answer my questions.",Postive
2032,2032,"Overall, it is not bad! There is a special car to pick up and drop off from the airport ~ and the hotel service attitude is very good. But the hotel is an old five-star hotel after all, so the facilities are average, the toilet light is broken, the socket in the room always fails to charge, and the wireless network signal is not very good. However, I ignored it. The location of the hotel is not bad. Taxis and buses are very convenient for traveling. There is a bus stop next to the hotel, and a No. 87 bus can go to Xiamen University and Huandao Road. After that, you can transfer to other scenic spots, especially Gulangyu Island, which is very close. I always walk there as a walk! During the four-day and three-night free trip, I basically visited all the scenic spots, which was a bit tight. I also signed up for a one-day tour of Tulou on the same trip. I was tired but happy at the same time! This trip was very enjoyable. I mainly took my mother to relax. My mother was very satisfied with this trip and said she would come to Xiamen next time! Xiamen is a very suitable city to live in! Then I would also like to thank the customer service of Tongcheng Travel.com, because I am a very troubled person, and thank you for patiently answering my questions.

2033,2033,"I am very satisfied with my trip to Xiamen this time. Because I brought children, the trip was quite leisurely! <br>On the first day, we departed from Shanghai and took Juneyao Airlines to Xiamen (Juneyao Airlines’ service was pretty good, and we also let us take the children’s strollers on the plane. The flight attendants were very enthusiastic and gave the baby a small toy). However, we encountered traffic control and arrived in Xiamen nearly an hour later than expected. Fortunately, a pick-up service was arranged on the same journey, which saved us from waiting in long lines for taxis! The driver's attitude is also very good. He will receive a call when he gets off the plane, and he is very considerate and helps to put the luggage. Full marks! ps: I want to say here that if you plan to stay on Gulangyu Island on the first day, remember to buy the ferry ticket before boarding the plane. Ordinary tickets end at 16:30 at the latest, and deluxe tickets end at 17:30. If it is later, you will have to buy a night flight. of votes. To buy ferry tickets, you can follow the official account xmferry and buy tickets in advance to make plans. We stayed at the Gulang Villa Hotel on Gulangyu Island on the first night. There is a beach in front of the hotel. The hotel has a swimming pool and the room has a balcony. Anyway, it is very stylish. It was already quite late after dinner that night and it was a little rainy, so I recharged myself in the hotel and took an early rest. <br>The next day, I woke up to the buffet breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast was average, but since there are plenty of snacks in Gulangyu Island, breakfast is not that important! We checked out of the room around 9:30, left our luggage in the hotel, and went shopping. After walking for a long time, we finally arrived at the busiest Longtou Road. I bought Ye’s mochi, bamboo shoot jelly and other snacks, and also bought dried meat to send back. Basically just shopping and eating... My baby couldn't walk when he saw the beach, so I bought him a set of shovels and buckets and spent most of the day on the beach. We left Gulangyu Island at about 4 o'clock and checked into the Pan Pacific Hotel. The quality is even higher and the service is super good. We upgraded the room at our own expense. We can overlook Gulangyu Island and see the sea. It feels very good. We will have dinner at Xiamen University Yes, my sister is at Xiamen University, and she took us to eat Sha Cha Noodles in their cafeteria, which tasted quite good. <br>On the third day, I felt that my baby really got into the sand, and played on the beach all morning again. I had lunch at Xiamen University. In the afternoon, I visited the Furong Tunnel and walked around the school. My sister After class, we went to eat seafood with us. The restaurant we went to was called Xiaojing Seafood City. The price was quite reasonable and the taste was great. <br>On the fourth day, we are about to return today. I haven’t been to Chaofu City opposite the hotel yet. Hurry up, pack up, check out, and store your luggage in the hotel to eat at Chaofu City. The variety is really overwhelming. Order Everyone was dazzled and didn’t know what to order. We all wanted to eat it. In the end, we ordered crispy barbecued pork buns, shrimp dumplings, cowboy short ribs, durian cakes, and coconut. I forgot what else we ordered. Anyway, it was really good. Super delicious ~ add two more and it will be super delicious. It's amazing... I will go there to eat next time. If you are a foodie, don't miss it. At 12:30, we arranged for a driver to drop off the plane at the airport. We flew with Spring Airlines. Hey, I will never fly with this airline again in this life. My sister and I also charged 160 ocean for checked luggage. Not to mention the service, there was no service at all.

2034,2034,"The locals are very welcoming! At first, I was worried that the weather would be bad. But actually, there was no need to worry about it. Even if it rained, it would be over in a short while! You can bring some clothes. I brought 6 sets but they were not enough to wear. The weather will be very humid. As soon as I stepped out of the hotel door, I was wet! The Pan Pacific Hotel where we stayed on the first and second night was really great and the breakfast was delicious! It gives people a very comfortable feeling. You must buy a ferry ticket four or five days in advance to go to Gulangyu Island! I just didn’t buy the ferry ticket two days in advance! Don’t worry if you haven’t bought it yet. You can contact the hotel and ask them to help you. You only need to provide the guest information. Then take the evening ferry to Gulangyu Island! What you must remind here is that when he asks you to queue up to buy tickets, you'd better go early because there are really many people! I waited in line for two hours to get a ticket! I was unlucky enough to encounter a typhoon, so I barely got to do anything on the island, which was actually a pity! The hotels on the island may not be as good as the Pan Pacific and there are quite a lot of mosquitoes! And walking on the island is really tiring! Finally, I would like to say that most of the food I eat is seafood. Maybe I am from Jiangsu and I am not used to it, but I am traveling! The last sentence is really hot and humid over there! Watch out for colds! I hope I want to go to Xiamen again next time to visit Gulangyu Island!",Postive

Fortunately, I bought the ferry ticket to Gulangyu Island 5 days in advance. 13: 50 successfully boarded the ship and landed on the island. Check into Gulangyu Villa Hotel. The hotel has a good environment, but it's a bit far from Longtou Road. In the evening, we had dinner on the commercial street of Gulangyu Island. There were too many snacks and I was full of food. Of course, it’s also nice to take a walk along the seaside. <br>The next day, I left Gulangyu Island at 10 o'clock and came to the Pan Pacific Hotel. I packed up and set off for Xiamen University and Nanputuo. After waiting for Wulaofeng in Nanputuo, I was still very tired. I went down the mountain and found a ginger duck snack bar in the cat museum. The ginger duck was very good. <br>On the third day, I ordered a battery car on Dianping in advance, picked it up at the west gate of Xiamen University, and then rode the Huandao Road. We also went to Huli Mountain Fort. At noon, we rode to Zengcuo’an and ate various Xiamen snacks. In particular, the mangoes in Xiamen are really great. <br>On the fourth day, we took a flight at 4pm, had breakfast and stored our luggage in the hotel. In the morning, I walked around Huwei Mountain and Bay Park near the Pan Pacific Hotel. At noon, I went to Zhongshan Road to buy specialties.

The pool in the room is different from that of other hotels, which is not convenient to use. The sound insulation performance of the room is not good. You can hear the noise from the corridor inside. The sound, the curtains are not very light-blocking, and I can see a trace of sunlight when I wake up in the morning. In addition, the breakfast provided is also relatively average and the taste is not very good. However, the fruits in Xiamen are richer and not bad. The waiter at the rambutan side does not put them in the dining area. You need to ask her before she goes inside to take them out. , I also saw other tourists asking, but this was not done well. In addition, Tongcheng's service is okay, but this is not so good. When ordering the product, I was asked to book a double bed room, but when I arrived, I was told that only standard rooms were available. Otherwise, I had to pay more to book a better one. , and later I asked Tongcheng, didn’t they help me book it? They said they had booked it, but now they haven’t.

Zhongshan Road: Peanut soup is recommended, a bit sweet. <br>The next day, Nanputuo, Xiamen University. I recommend a god-like bus route. Route 950 passes by almost everywhere you go in Xiamen. You might as well try the vegetarian food in Nan Putuo for 118 yuan for a small set for 2 people. The entrance to Xiamen University is full of local guides. You can enter even if it is not open. The price is 40 yuan per person. I think you can negotiate the price. <br>On the third day, Zengcuo'an, a small and fresh neighborhood, with various snacks and specialty shops, is recommended for those who like to take pictures. We just went to Jimei University for a walk, but we didn’t do much because we caught up with a typhoon. <br>On the fourth day, Gulangyu Island, I almost didn’t go to the island because of the typhoon, but I was lucky enough to land on the island around 11 o’clock. The island is not big, so I walked the whole way, and had various snacks. I took the stamps I bought before going to the island. Stamped everywhere. <br>On the fifth day, go home. Well, the flight on the itinerary said it was after 8 a.m., which was too early. I changed it myself and it was for a flight after 1 p.m., so there was no need to rush.

Although it's a bit far from the scenic spot, it only costs about 50 yuan to take a taxi, which is pretty good. <br>For places to visit, we went to Xiamen University, Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, and Gulangyu Island.

Although you have to take transportation to travel, the surroundings are relatively quiet, and the front desk is very gentle and attentive. My husband and I are super happy. Because Gulangyu Island has to apply for a World Heritage Site, the number of visitors to the island is limited to 15,000 per day, and I can't even buy a ferry ticket. Unexpectedly, Gulangyu Villa Hotel sent staff to queue up for us to buy tickets. I was so touched. Xiamen is so hot! They also queued up for us. Later, when we were queuing up to take the boat, other tourists nearby said that they spent 300 to find scalpers and were not sure if they had tickets. Moreover, the hotel did not let us go to the island. We were only 35, and we felt happy instantly! There is also a battery car to pick you up on the island. Other tourists who walked to the hotel with their suitcases were almost envious**... It is worth mentioning that both hotels have gyms and swimming pools, and the breakfasts are very good, although it was a bit inconsistent at first to book the room.

It is recommended that you must choose a day to sign up for a group tour or rent a car to see the earth buildings. <br>4. Don’t let the taxi driver recommend a hotel to you, it’s a scam. I only recommend two places to eat seafood, Xiaoyan Food stall and Ganhai Squid. Remember, it is enough to only go to these two places to eat. The rest are nonsense. No matter what the chef says, you have to stick to it. <br>5. There is no need to go to Dadeng Island. The so-called duty-free shops are all nonsense.

Standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows at night and looking at the beautiful night view, but don’t consume food in the refrigerator. I drank two cans of Coke for 36 yuan😢… …The hotel has a swimming pool, but unfortunately I didn’t bring a swimsuit. What I like most is the hotel’s breakfast buffet, which is very filling, haha! Let’s talk about the itinerary. After settling in the hotel on the first day, I went straight to Zhongshan Road. The taxi cost about 15 yuan. I was very lucky. I met local drivers in Xiamen these days. The Hokkien dialect is so good^_^ . Zhongshan Road is all about eating, shopping, and eating all the places recommended by internet celebrities. After breakfast the next morning, we went straight to Gulangyu Island. I bought the boat ticket in advance on the ** official account. It was very convenient to swipe my ID card. Gulangyu Island is so beautiful. Every building is unique. I held hands with my husband and basked in the sun. It’s super comfortable to walk around and sing a tune, but it’s still very sunny in Xiamen in November, so be sure to wear sunscreen. I’m already blushing -_-#. On the third day, we fed pigeons and lay down to bask in the sun in Bailuzhou Park. We enjoyed the sea breeze on the beach and listened to a free mini concert. We rented a tandem bicycle on the road around the island and rode around and sang. It was super relaxing. I arrived at the gate of Xiamen University on time at 5 pm. There was already a long queue of tourists. I bought a hand-drawn map of Xiamen University for one yuan. The students of Xiamen University are very nice and friendly when asking for directions and saying hello. The trip to Xiamen University ended in the Furong Tunnel. The murals on the tunnel made people miss their youth and college days, and thought that it had been so long since they graduated without knowing it. I checked out after breakfast on the fourth day. Since my flight was around 4 p.m., I stored my luggage and went to Zengcuoyan, which is known as the most complete original ecological fishing village in Xiamen. It is full of delicious food and small bars where handsome men and beautiful women gather. , but I don’t like it, Gulangyu is still comfortable. I went to Class 2 of Grade 3 for lunch. I had to wear a red scarf when eating. It felt so cute, haha! So farewell to my first trip to Xiamen. I will definitely come back when I have time!",Postive

The driver who picked us up from the airport happened to be the same person, and he was also very nice. We spent 116 a night at the hotel to upgrade the room. In fact, the room was bigger and the floor was higher. I have been to Xiamen several times, and this time I just wanted to take my husband to visit it, mainly for leisure. I sleep until I wake up naturally every day and then go shopping around. The same itinerary is quite reasonable. On the first day after the flight, put your luggage at the hotel and take Route 31 directly to Zhongshan Road. It is recommended to go to the open-air dining area on the 7th floor of Lujiang Hotel to eat and enjoy the scenery. Opposite is the night view of Gulangyu Island and Lujiang River, which is very beautiful! We went back to the hotel and took a classic car rental. Although it was twice as expensive as a regular rental, it was very spacious and comfortable. The next day I went to Nanputuo Temple of Xiamen University and ate vegetarian noodles. I went to Zuocuo'an in the afternoon. I originally wanted to cycle around the island road, but my husband said he was tired, so he took a taxi back to the hotel and rested. That's the best thing about free travel, it's more casual. Went to Little Glasses in the evening. The food was pretty good. It was very convenient to go to Gulangyu Pier on the third day. Route 87 or L5 is just 2 stops away from the hotel entrance. I took a luxury boat to Neicuoao Pier and came back from Sanqiutian. This is more reasonable and does not have to turn back. We walked around the island for a week, eating snacks along the way, and had dinner at Chaofu City opposite the hotel in the evening. I feel like 3-4 days is just right to visit Xiamen.

Turn right after exiting the hotel door. There is a bus stop under the overpass. Take bus 31 to the Maternal and Child Health Hospital or get off at the ferry station. You can find the pedestrian street across the road! Very easy to find! <br>The next day, I went to Xiamen University and Nanputuo Temple. Nanputuo and Xiamen University are very close. I went there in the morning. Now I have walked around Nanputuo, and Xiamen University only let me in after 12 o'clock! After walking around Xiamen University, I went to Furong Restaurant for lunch!

Wow, what a great explosion of character! The airport pick-up man took us directly to the Wyndham Hotel. We were upgraded to a deluxe sea view room for free and I was instantly impressed when we entered the hotel. The service is excellent. Each room has a private butler who brought us children's supplies, welcome fruit tea (super delicious) and welcome fruit (especially sweet).

2057,2057,"Very attentive service. Tongcheng has always been so good. When I got off the plane, the driver contacted me. The special car was already waiting. I quickly arrived at the hotel. Since it was still early and I couldn't check in, I left my luggage at the hotel and went out to play. The public transportation near the hotel is very convenient, especially the 87 bus, which can go everywhere. When we checked in at 8 o'clock in the evening, we were told that the superior king-size bed room we booked was no longer available. We were upgraded to a deluxe king-size bed for free. The room was large and clean. , my wife and children loved it very much. I was very happy to stay in the hotel for three days. The weather in Xiamen was also very good and comfortable. The breakfast in the hotel was great. It is worthy of being a five-star hotel. Anyway, this trip on the same journey was great. Next Will continue to book trips with Tongcheng this time.",Postive
2058,2058,"The flight was on time, no issues. We stayed at the DoubleTree by Hilton, which opened last year. It was comfortable and clean. We had a sea view room and the view was really good. I'm also very satisfied with the breakfast. The buffet restaurant has rich food, fresh and clean. On the day of check-in, DoubleTree cookies were given as a gift, one for everyone. When I left, the foreigner's lobby manager saw the baby crying and gave me another two yuan. The service was very considerate. There are two swimming pools in the hotel. The temperature of the smaller one is suitable for babies, but it is a bit small. The water temperature in the large pool is on the low side, but the baby didn't feel any discomfort. It's a good family trip. The only inconvenience is that the hotel is far away from the scenic spot, and the average taxi cost is more than 80 yuan one way. In four days, taking a taxi probably cost one thousand yuan. <br>Gulangyu Island, Zhongshan Road, Zeng Cuo'an has too much consumption expenditure, a cup of milk tea is 20 yuan, four pieces of sliced ​​duck is 20 yuan, and large and small intestines are 20 yuan. It is not cost-effective, and the food tastes not good. These scenic spots are like a street of rip-offs. However, I have to give a thumbs up to the seafood stall at No. 141 Kaiyuan Road. It is indeed of high quality and low price.",Postive
2059,2059,"Gulangyu Island no longer has the same style as it did a few years ago. I don’t know whether it is due to reconstruction after the typhoon or because it is becoming more commercialized step by step. The strong artistic atmosphere at the beginning is nowhere to be found now. The island can only be seen from the dilapidated old houses. Of course, it is prosperous now, but it lacks a bit of flavor. It does not have the tranquility of the small fishing village on Weizhou Island, nor the charm of the ancient towns of Suzhou and Hangzhou. All that is left is the constant sound of hawking. Fortunately, the place where I live is isolated, and it still has the charm. Accompanied by the sound of birdsong. Of course, the slightly cool air is still pleasant, but it's just a little boring. Xiamen has also changed a lot. There are many more high-rise buildings and it is more prosperous. I was very satisfied with the service on this trip. I was given free mangoes and airport pick-up. The service was very good.",Postive

If there is any problem, we can help solve it in time. It is very considerate and makes traveling worry-free and secure. The airport pick-up service is very suitable for us. , the original journey with a small child has become a lot less stressful, the itinerary is also very user-friendly, not tiring, not compact, and the flight time can be chosen at will before travel, and can be matched as desired to meet the different needs of different people.

Let me focus on the Xiamen Jingmin Center Hotel. The hardware is a little bit worse than a five-star hotel, but the service is not that good. The service was very attentive and left a good impression on us. Xiamen is a clean city with a good climate and nice people. Didi taxis were available throughout the journey and the taxi drivers were very good. Gulangyu Island feels a bit like Qingdao Badaguan, but there are too many tour groups. Generally speaking, the vacation booked through Tongcheng was very good. I will book with Tongcheng next time. I hope Tongcheng will get better and better.",Postive

The room will be cleaned every day according to your needs. The free buffet breakfast is rich in variety. The location is very close to various scenic spots and the transportation is convenient.

My child hurt his foot by the hotel's doorbell. He injured his ankle and was unable to walk, which ruined the plan. The door latch in the hotel is a safety hazard. I will send pictures for everyone to see later. <br> The hotel's location is very good and the transportation is very convenient.

2064,2064,"The hotel has a great location! There are buses directly to various attractions, and it only takes ten minutes to walk to the Dongdu Cruise Terminal. As a five-star hotel, it may be due to its old construction. The rooms are not very big and the hardware is not that ideal. The swimming pool is outdoor and not big. Breakfast is quite rich. The service attitude is also good! Personally, I don’t think it’s suitable for taking children to play. It’s too tiring and there aren’t any good attractions suitable for them. It’s more suitable for foodies! Because there are delicious food everywhere😋",Postive

Xiamen has pleasant scenery, fresh air, and hygienic environment. Gulangyu Island has its own unique flavor! <br>We also tasted Xiamen’s local specialties, and bought coconut crisps, nougat, and butcher shops for friends from unique shops in Xiamen! <br>Although I have returned home, I still have feelings for Xiamen!

I choose Air China for all flights, and I basically arrive on time.",Postive
2071,2071,"Accommodation: <br> The first one is Pan Pacific. The accommodation conditions are really great, the service attitude is always very good, and there is a big bathtub that I like, hahaha. It is so beautiful to take a bath and drink a glass of red wine at night. And I want to say that there is really nothing to say about Pacific’s breakfast buffet. My motivation for the day comes from this breakfast. <br> The second picture is of Gulangyu villa accommodation. The accommodation is really average. The picture shows the room I changed into for ➕170 yuan per day. There is a swimming pool in the hotel. It is good to go back to the hotel for a swim at night, but the breakfast here is really bad. This makes me very confused...the milk at Pan Pacific is all pure milk, but the milk at this one is made with milk powder. It tastes terrible, and the food I eat is not as good as Pan Pacific. And the service attitude here is not as good as that of Pan Pacific. He takes your luggage and leaves immediately, which makes me feel like he is going to take my luggage and run away. When I take the elevator, he goes up first and doesn't care about us. Just press this to open it, regardless of the elevator door. Moreover, the two days we stayed were just in time for renovation... it was crazy... it was not as good as the Pacific Hotel anyway. <br><br>Itinerary:<br> The third picture is Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. There are many delicious foods and many local specialties, such as ""Soil Bamboo Shoot Jelly (it tastes good), Mango (it tastes like the mango I ate in Beijing). Almost the same, but very delicious), seafood (there are a lot of seafood I have never seen before, like water devils, etc., they look very scary...), ginger duck (I heard from locals that there is a lot of ginger in it, I was still I was afraid that the ginger flavor would be too strong, but when I ate it, it tasted good, but one pot for two people was a bit too much and a bit greasy), Shacha noodles (I didn’t think it was very tasty, it smelled like mung bean soup) ) etc.” I won’t list them one by one. <br> The fourth picture is the scenery in Xiamen University. To be honest, except for Furong Tunnel and Furong Pond, which are worth seeing, everything else in Xiamen University is pretty much the same. However, Xiamen’s greening is really good, everywhere. Green, I didn’t eat the food from Xiamen University as other guides said, because I know that the most unpalatable food in the world is in the school...<br> The fifth picture is the Furong Tunnel, but what I want to say is that it is the least delicious. The ones with poor quality are those uneducated country bumpkin Chinese who insist on scribbling on other people’s paintings to create a good work. They do not respect the fruits of other people’s labor at all. If everyone does not protect these local characteristics, sooner or later there will be Not a day will exist anymore. <br> The sixth picture is Zengcuo'an. The alley in Zengcuo'an is very winding. There are many special snacks and many very literary and artistic shops. It is very suitable for young people to have fun and eat. <br> The seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth pictures are the scenery of Gulangyu Island. It is beautiful, but it still makes people speechless. A beautiful island can be seen everywhere**...the beach is also everywhere**, if people Everyone can cherish a little bit, but I don’t think this will be the case. <br>Drinks in Xiamen are really expensive... Coke, Sprite, iced black tea and other drinks that cost 3 yuan in Beijing cost 6-10 yuan in Xiamen. Mineral water also costs 6 yuan...a bit confusing~",Postive
2072,2072,"This time I chose Tongcheng and I found it very convenient to place an order there, as the itinerary arrangement prices are clear at a glance. After placing the order, I was very unhappy because I was asked to add an additional 210 yuan. Because we arrived at the airport at 5:30 in the afternoon and took a taxi to the city at around 6:30, it was wise to choose to stay in Xiamen on the first day with children. It would be really troublesome to go to Gulangyu Island on the first day according to the same itinerary arrangement. First of all, we need to sail at night, and we can't see much scenery. Moreover, we disembark at Sanqiutian Pier, and our hotel is in Neicuo'ao. There is no transportation at night and it is really tiring to drag luggage with children. It was wise to stay in the city on the first day. Although I accepted the extra money, it was very uncomfortable. <br>The hotel Fantai in downtown Xiamen is very good. The surrounding transportation is very convenient and it is also close to Zhongshan Road. The hotel room is also good, it is a suite, very spacious, but unfortunately there is no view. If you are looking for a great view, it is recommended to choose a hotel by the sea. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, and there are basically Xiamen's special snacks, so you don't have to go out to eat. <br>I went to Xiamen University on the first day, which happened to coincide with the marathon. I walked around Xiamen University, the environment is very good, and the Furong Tunnel is also very unique. Then we went to Huandao Road and had a great time cycling. My wife and children were very happy. The meal we had at the time-honored seafood restaurant next to the Huli Mountain Fort was rated four stars. The seafood was very fresh. A grouper with oysters and scallops only cost 200 yuan. <br>I set off to Gulangyu Island the next day. I booked the ferry ticket on ** one day in advance, so I went there leisurely. Staying at the Four Seasons Hotel, the environment is very average. It is recommended to stay in a four-star hotel on the island. I walked to the commercial street that day. The tour bus on the island is too expensive, 50 yuan per person. Now Gulangyu Island is too commercialized, and the good environment is full of copper odor. <br>I went to climb Sunlight Rock on the third day. The weather was good that day, the scenery was picturesque, and I had a lot of fun. Leave the island and go to the airport in the afternoon.",Postive

Due to some reasons, the initially scheduled personnel changed, but Tongcheng travel consultants Wu Xiaosen and Ina were really patient and patiently helped me change personnel and minimized the loss, making this trip smooth and enjoyable! <br>Day 1: Fly to Xiamen Gaoqi Airport, then ferry to Four Seasons Hotel. Although we ended up with only three adults staying, the hotel still gave us four breakfast coupons. Moreover, the hotel service is also good. They will store your luggage for you after you check out the next day, making it easy for you to visit Gulangyu Island. Gulangyu Island is very fun, the small shops are very atmospheric, and there are many snacks, which are delicious. <br>The next day: Check out directly after breakfast in the morning, store your luggage, and enjoy Gulangyu Island. Bought a lot of gifts. Since express delivery stops accepting orders during the Chinese New Year, and SF Express is too expensive, many stores can mail specialties home. This is really convenient. In the evening, take the ferry back to Xiamen and check into the Xiamen Sheraton Hotel. The service is very good and the facilities and environment are good. <br>Day 3: The breakfast is super rich, and it’s not until 10:30, so you don’t have to eat later. After breakfast, we went to Tan Kah Kee Memorial Hall, then had some food nearby and went to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. Dinner was served on the pedestrian street. <br>Day 4: Public transportation in Xiamen is very convenient. I took the bus to Xiamen University. Xiamen University is so big and artistic. Furong Tunnel and Lover's Valley are very good. Then we went to Nanputuo Temple, right next to Xiamen University. Finally, we had snacks on Zhongshan Road and had a lot of fun. <br>Day 5: After breakfast, I prepared my luggage and went to the airport to wait for my flight.

I finished packing at 4 o'clock, went to bed at 5 o'clock, and got up at 7 o'clock! When we got up and opened the balcony door, there were green plants. Thanks to the hotel staff, they arranged a room in a non-smoking area for us. After cleaning up, we went to eat! There are both Chinese and Western food, buffet style, and I even met a handsome foreign guy, hehe! After dinner, the rain outside just stopped, so I walked with my best friend from the hotel to the highway. The mood was great! There are green plants all around! Then we took the bus to Robinson Shopping Plaza, then went to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, and finally returned to the hotel with our loot! I went to bed at 10:30, a little tired! I got up at 6 o'clock the next morning and started the journey again! We originally made a reservation to go to Gulangyu Island the day before, but the earliest boat to the cruise terminal was at 11:10, so we decided to go to Xiamen University to hang out! However, Xiamen University is really amazing! There are more people there! You still have to queue up to enter the school with your ID card! When I entered, there happened to be students filming a movie, which felt great! The whole school is very big, the environment is very good, there is water and green plants! That day was the coldest day in Xiamen, 1 to 3 degrees, which was just the right temperature for us! The air is also good! The meal at Xiamen University was very crowded, but I really liked Xiamen’s specialty snack, Sha Cha Noodles, which are sweet and spicy!

2077,2077,"The following is my evaluation of this trip<br>1 Transportation: The flight to Xiamen was delayed for 1 hour at Hongqiao Airport and flew for more than an hour. When I was about to land at Gaoqi Airport, I was unable to land due to weather reasons. The plane was very bumpy in the sky. After circling and still unable to land, we temporarily decided to divert to Fuzhou Changle Airport and wait for instructions from the command center before flying to Gaoqi Airport. The waiting time for the flight was about 50 minutes. Lunch and food were available for the flight. The landing time in Gaoqi was 5 p.m. There was no meal available. It is understandable, but due to the alternate landing time at Fuzhou Changle Airport The manager did not provide meals, which is not good enough; when traveling in Xiamen, we took taxis if we did not take public transportation<br>2 Accommodation and meals: The Pan Pacific Hotel we stayed at was about 40 yuan in Uber from the airport. The hotel arranged for us behind the 13th floor. The mountain is relatively quiet. We had a lot of problems with our room. There were cockroaches, leaks in the air conditioner, and door card demagnetization. The hotel also solved them one by one. The attitude was great. The breakfast was a buffet. The taste was average. The variety of breakfast for three days was almost a bit boring. There was a waiter in the hotel. I had a particularly good impression. At that time, when we pressed the elevator button on the 12th floor, the elevator attendant saw us and asked us kindly: Can I come with you? We said of course she thanked her several times and then stood in the corner of the elevator and arrived at our floor on the 13th floor. When the elevator opened the door, she bowed to us at 30 degrees and pointed one hand towards the elevator and said: Walk slowly, so the whole hotel gave me a very good impression. <br>3 Tourist Attractions: We went to Zengcuo'an, a famous scenic spot in Xiamen, at Shapowei. Zengcuo'an was overcrowded and fooled foreigners. We walked around for several times without getting out and were covered in sweat.<br>Super tired, what about the Gulangyu Fortress? I haven’t gone to Maan Coffee, which is available in Suzhou every afternoon. There aren’t many restaurants to eat at until evening. The breakfast provided by the hotel every day makes me full, so I’m not hungry all day long<br>4 Customer Service: Tongcheng I am quite satisfied with the customer service service and will patiently answer questions<br>ps: Picture 1 is the hotel Picture 234 is anyway in Shapowei Picture 5 is a place in Shapowei Art West District Picture 6 is the roasted bird in Shapowei Izakaya picture 78 is maan coffee afternoon tea<br>Wish you all a happy journey:)",Postive

2080,2080,"I have to say that Tongcheng is really considerate and has text messages all the way. The plane from Wuxi to Xiamen was delayed for more than ten minutes and the flight time is two hours. When I arrived in Xiamen, I contacted the pick-up guy and he will send you to the hotel door. We checked in just in time. There was a room available, so I checked in at 12 o'clock. In the afternoon, I took a taxi to Zengcuo'an in Xiamen. It was really cheap and only cost 30 yuan. The driver was also very friendly and would not deliberately take you a long way. When you arrived, he would also tell you where to go to Zengcuo'an. There are all kinds of things to eat, eat, buy, buy, buy, and buy all kinds of Xiamen delicacies and specialties. The dazzling seafood is really cheap. The oysters are 15 yuan for 16 pieces. They are so cheap. I must buy them. Do you have two hours to finish shopping at Zengcuo'an and cross the overpass to Huandao Road? Taking photos on the beach. The weather in Xiamen in March was quite cold and I couldn’t go into the water. However, I went barefoot to the shore and took a few photos. The sea water was really cool. I recommend renting a bicycle and cycling along the Huandao Road. You can take photos along the way and have dinner. Eat seafood. . The next day is the highlight of Gulangyu Island. After reading the previous reviews, I bought the ferry ticket on ** one day in advance. It is very convenient to swipe your ID card and board the ship. If you take the ferry at the cruise center, just tell the driver to go to the cruise center. Anyway, we can get there in minutes from Pan Pacific to the cruise center for a starting price of 10 yuan. It is recommended to buy the Gulangyu attractions coupon or not. Personally, I don’t think it makes much sense. After all, it is to earn your one-time money as a tourist. You can walk around Gulangyu and take photos at the beach, and you can go to Longtou Road to eat. Everything on Gulangyu is generally more expensive. So it is not recommended to eat seafood on the island. The third day is Xiamen University. Xiamen University is really good! big! A bicycle is a must for students on campus. It’s really tiring to walk around. However, my personal suggestion is that the Furong Tunnel and Lover’s Valley are worth visiting. If you plan to have lunch at the Furong Restaurant, you should go early, otherwise you will have to queue up. Tourists eat at third floor. In the afternoon, you can go to Nanputuo next to it. The incense is very popular. There are many devout tourists. You can see many volunteers in the Buddhist temple. This is rare in many temples in China. Then there is the Huli Mountain Fortress. The ticket is 25. If you catch up, you can still see the performance. It is a pity. It rained on the day we went and we were unable to catch the performance. Unfortunately, we could take photos with many cannons as a souvenir. On the last day, you can go to Zhongshan Road to eat and then go home.",Postive

The hotel's breakfast is also very rich, worthy of a five-star rating, and children under 1.2 meters tall are free of charge for breakfast! The biggest headache was the plane. The flight from Shenyang to Xiamen was delayed by more than an hour due to air traffic control. When we came back, air traffic control was two and a half hours late. A two-day round trip would be in vain! The Pan Pacific Hotel has a very good location and very convenient transportation. Xiamen University, Nanputuo Temple, Zengcuo'an, Xiamen University Baicheng, and Route 87 are all accessible, and the price is only one yuan, air-conditioned car! I think Gulangyu Island is too commercialized and the central location is quite chaotic. There are all kinds of specialties and snacks for sale. I like Zeng Cuo'an even more!

We booked from March 22nd to 25th, departing from Wuxi. The morning flight was more than 10 minutes late, not bad! It's a two-hour flight. When you arrive in Xiamen, the pick-up crew will contact you and take you to the door of your hotel. The pick-up will be by car-pooling bus. There happened to be a vacant room when we checked in, so we checked in at around 12 o'clock. I chose the 19th floor. The room was grand and had an independent cloakroom. The service of the five-star hotel is first-rate. Once I couldn't log in to the wireless network, I called the switchboard and immediately sent a network administrator to check and use it again. After taking a short rest, we couldn’t wait to leave the hotel, haha! Amap is our right-hand assistant. We relied on it during our four days in Xiamen. The whole trip was by public transport and the price was 1 yuan, which was convenient and affordable! There is a bus stop not far from the hotel entrance, and you can get directly to your destination for just one dollar. There are a lot of food at Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. I bought Ba Popo’s Shaoxiancao, A Ming’s Oyster Omelette, Shacha Noodles, Jellied Bamboo Shoots, and Huang Zehe’s Peanut Soup. I recommend everyone to try the oyster omelette! I found a very petty bourgeois store called ""Ms. Zhao's Store"". This store is next to an old tree. I don't know if it's the main store, but it's pretty big anyway. The key is that the male salespeople are all good-looking. I'm tired of shopping. Sit down and take a rest. The style in the store is amazing, and my best friend and I took a lot of photos. The hotel's breakfast buffet was on the second day. I found that there were many foreigners and there were many varieties. You will definitely find what you like. The waiter will arrange a seat and ask if you would like tea or coffee. Take the bus to Baicheng Beach in front of the hotel. It is a good choice to take the bus there if you are not in a hurry. By the way, you can see the city scenery of Xiamen and visit Baicheng Beach, Nanputuo, Xiamen University, and Zengcuo'an. In Nanputuo, you can climb Wulao Peak, and there are incense gifts in the temple. Xiamen University can enter from 12:00 to 2:00 from Monday to Friday, and can enter after 5:00 pm. Entry is not allowed at other times. There is no limit on Saturdays and Sundays. You can enter by swiping your ID card. It is recommended to go to Furong Tunnel. Zeng Cuo'an recommended ""Shanshan's shop"" and wrote postcards and printed photos of best friends. The female boss has a good service attitude. Visit Gulangyu Island on the third day! I bought a ferry ticket on ** one day in advance for 35 yuan per person, which is very convenient. You can board the ship just by swiping your ID card. Tourists take the ferry at the cruise center. We still arrive at the cruise center by bus. **Buy a package ticket online for 90 yuan. It is recommended to go to Sunlight Rock. If you have children, you can go to Zheng Chenggong Memorial Hall. It has patriotic educational significance. On the fourth day, take bus No. 87 to Bailuzhou Park. It’s free. It’s also good to walk around and feed the pigeons. At noon, we recommend the Zhaoqiang seafood food stall. The two of us ate enough seafood for 200 yuan. The chef who took you to the airport arrived at 13:45, so worry-free! If you want to buy Xiamen specialties, I recommend the app SouLi.com. We placed the order the night before and picked it up at the airport the next day. It was very convenient. The price was even better than in other stores, and we didn’t have to carry it around. go. I was very satisfied with my trip to Xiamen. I had fun for four days. The only regret was that it rained for the first three days and the sun finally showed up on the last day! Trust Tongcheng and book with Tongcheng next time!",Postive

2088,2088,"I went there with a classmate and a child. Generally speaking, everything went smoothly and there were no mistakes on the way there and back! The hotel we stayed in was very high-end. Unfortunately, the weather was not good when we got there. It was hazy and rainy, and the boats were stopped. What a pity! Tongcheng’s customer service is very good and patient. If you have any questions, you can ask them! I have been to Xiamen before, and this time I accompanied a school. The children were quite happy, as long as they are happy😊! Riyue Valley Hot Spring is super expensive. It’s so expensive. It’s far different from the OCT Hot Spring I visited in Taizhou. Older children are paying full admission. There’s not even a rest hall, no indoor hot spring, and no children to play with. The amusement facilities were so disappointing. We, two adults and two children, got bored after playing two or three of them. We spent more than a thousand yuan and it was not worth it! Since I couldn't go to Gulangyu Island, I went to Zengcuojian. It was nice to go shopping there. There was a beach opposite. As soon as the children arrived at the beach, it started to rain😫! I also went to Nanputuo, which didn’t seem to be interesting.",Postive
2089,2089,"This time it was a walk-in trip: a five-day and four-night trip to Xiamen. It was the first time I used the same trip to book air tickets and hotels at the five-star Sheraton Hotel. The website recommended a late flight, so I paid more money to take a morning flight in order to visit more attractions. However, there were unexpected weather conditions, and heavy rains in Tianjin prevented us from taking off normally. As a result, we were delayed for more than ten hours and still took off at night (it was destined to be at night, My extra money was wasted). But I was finally able to take off normally, checked into the hotel at night, and spent the first day at Tianjin Airport like this😄. The next day I went to Xiamen's most famous scenic spot ""Gulangyu Island"" and experienced the different scenery and culture. Due to the large number of people and the hot weather, it was not as good as what people said in the guide before, but the green vegetation there really attracted me from the north. people. On the third day, I went to Zengcuo'an and cycled around the island road. It felt similar to Gulangyu Island. The commercial atmosphere was too strong, but I had an unexpected surprise here. I found a nice little restaurant: Xiangshen Bian Restaurant. As the name suggests, this place is exceptionally quiet compared to the crowded and noisy central area. The entire small street is built with local style buildings. The beautiful proprietress is a local living here and sells four kinds of classic snacks made at home. We chose three kinds of snacks for only 18 yuan. We were really surprised by the cheap and delicious snacks. We learned from the proprietress that the best time to visit Xiamen is November to December, as the weather is very good. After leaving this small shop, we rode the Huandao Road and visited the most famous Huandao Road in Xiamen. It was really good. Something special to mention here is the mosquitoes in Xiamen. My daughter is particularly attracted to mosquitoes. She was bitten by more than a dozen of them somewhere, and some even developed big blisters. As a result, she went to the hospital early on the fourth day. In fact, it’s not a big deal. I was just worried that I didn’t know what kind of insect bit me, which delayed my time in the morning😭. I went to Zhongshan Road Commercial Street and the Botanical Garden. The commercial street and Tianjin didn’t take long to visit. The botanical garden is still good, if the physical strength allows You can go hiking on your own, but it will be very tiring. We chose the observation car, mainly to see various vegetation, which was an eye-opener. The ticket is 40, and half price for students. In the evening, I ate sand tea noodles near the hotel, which was quite delicious. On the fifth day, we went to Xiamen University and Nanputuo. Nanputuo does not require admission, but there are many people. The temple is not big. There is an incense place on the right side of the entrance. Each person can get one. We burned incense and worshiped Buddha outside the first hall. , each hall prays devoutly to bless everything safely. There is a mountain climbing road at the back. We climbed back for a while, mainly because of the heat. Just outside the door you can go to the most famous Xiamen University, a garden-style university. The scenery inside is really great. It is worth mentioning the Furong Tunnel. On both sides of the tunnel are various works of students. The only regret is that there are no Public-minded people scribble on such fine works, which ruins the enjoyment of appreciation. Xiamen University’s Lover’s Valley is also worth a visit. It’s naturally relaxing to walk along the tree-lined path and enjoy the surrounding scenery. When I was about to leave Xiamen, I learned a few words of Hokkien from the driver. There is also a car to pick you up from the airport on the same journey in the evening, which is really considerate. The five-day trip ended successfully. Tips: It is more convenient to choose hotels around Siming District when going to Xiamen.",Postive

2091,2091,"It’s really convenient to book flights and hotels on the same journey. <br>Let’s talk about air tickets first. I added 100 yuan to the air ticket to Xiamen and changed it to a flight at 9:20. There is no need to rush, the plane is still China Eastern Airlines, and the return flight is a red-eye flight of Juneyao Airlines. Tongcheng provides round-trip transfer service from the airport to the hotel. When you arrive at Xiamen Gaoqi Airport, call them and they will arrange a car to take you to the hotel. Because it is a bus, it leaves once an hour. <br>As for the hotel, the Pan Pacific Hotel is located in Siming District. It is relatively close to all famous scenic spots. It is very convenient to go out. There is a bus station at the door. During this trip to Xiamen, my transportation method was buses. It's 1 yuan, just prepare a few more coins. I like their breakfast very much, there are a lot of fruits, my favorite! All tea bags are free, and drinks in the refrigerator are charged, unlike Kempinski. <br>Finally, I suggest you go to the Little Glasses Seafood Stall. I had my dinner there for three days. Take the No. 26 bus in front of the hotel and get off at Wenzao Station. It’s just a short walk away. Why did I choose this restaurant? Because it is of high quality and low price. It makes sense that the online reviews are very good. If I go to other restaurants, I am afraid that it will not be good. So after eating on the first day, I decided to eat at his restaurant whenever I have time. .",Postive
2092,2092,"This time it was a large family, thirteen in size. There was a previous review from a person who went there alone. The sea view room at the Swiss International Hotel I stayed in this time was great! A taxi from the airport should cost more than 40 yuan, but I don’t know why mine only cost more than 20 yuan. The driver also found it strange😃. Because there were so many people and many things were inconvenient, I only rented a car on the last day. It was so comfortable. It only cost 400 yuan a day. We gave the chef another 100 yuan as a tip. We don’t have to give it. I just think the chef is very nice. He took us wherever we wanted to go, including Huandao Road and Dadeng Island. There are also duty-free shops there. , you don’t have to go. It's very convenient to have one car. I don’t want to write about other attractions again, so I’ll copy them. However, the ferry tickets to Gulangyu Island must be purchased online first, otherwise you will have to wait for several hours. It’s also very convenient to buy them online! Follow Xiamen Ferry. Gulangyu Island is neither good nor bad. You will know it only after you go there. The seafood on the island is also good and not expensive. The ones close to the villa hotel are cheaper. For locals, Xiamen University is better to go at night, but there is a traffic jam there. Zengcuo'an'an specializes in snacks and specialties. Locals say it's better to go to Zhongshan Road, which is cheaper, such as meat skewers. The Eighth Granny's cooking of grass jelly is mediocre, and the food in a small shop next to her is terrible! The meat of the scallops was also cut into many pieces and served as scallops for the guests to eat. But you can give peanut soup a try. I don’t remember much else, can I make up the record?",Postive

2095,2095,"Thanks to Tongcheng Travel for the arrangement, my husband and I returned from the trip smoothly! A first-class hotel, the Pan Pacific Hotel! Five-star hotel affordable price, great service! Stayed for 4 consecutive nights. Breakfast was included in the itinerary. The breakfast buffet was excellent, including Chinese, Western, Japanese and Xiamen special breakfasts, as well as various juices, yogurts and very fresh fruits! After breakfast, you can go out and turn left to the bus station. Through this station, you can definitely get around Xiamen. Xiamen's public transportation is so developed and convenient, including the Ferry Terminal, Xiagu Pier, Zengcuo'an Zhongshan Road, Xiamen University Nanputuo Temple SM Shopping Plaza, It’s so fun. It only costs one yuan for each bus ride. The one my husband and I take the most is bus 31, because we can go to Zhongshan Road to eat snacks. The biggest impression I have on Xiamen is that it’s hot and sunny. I’ve been paying for it these days. It was cloudy and rainy, and I ended up getting a tan. The sweltering heat felt a bit like a sauna. I didn’t like Gulangyu. I went there on a Friday. It was noisy and commercialized. There were houses and scenic spots being renovated everywhere on the island. They are wild tour guides and ticket sellers who are selling off tickets. I advise you not to pay attention to them. The combined ticket is sold at the official Gulangyu Island for 90 yuan per person, which is 10 yuan cheaper than at the ticket office. I personally feel that there is no need to go to those scenic spots and in Gulangyu Island. It's pretty beautiful just walking around. After a few hours of looking around, you'll find that everything is the same. The items in those specialty stores are very expensive and have little use when you buy them home. If you like them, you can buy them in Zengcuo'an, because they have the same items. It’s much cheaper than Gulangyu, although it’s also very expensive, because it’s half as valuable as Tao. The specialty snacks are clam omelette, which is pretty good. It’s very delicious with some Xiamen chili sauce. I especially recommend Ba Popo’s roasted jelly grass. It’s on a fork in Zhongshan Road for 6 yuan. A cup of red bean grass, grass jelly, taro balls, barley and peanuts at a very reasonable price. A full cup is refreshing, delicious and very low in calories! The mangoes in Xiamen are very delicious. Although I personally think they are not cheap, they are still very enjoyable to eat. Don't listen to the small glasses food stall online. The service is very poor and it only opens at 4:30 in the evening. We arrived at 3:30 and said we could wait in the store. But they said we turned off the air conditioning and you should go out. Be decisive. My husband and I went to the Jinjiagang Seafood Food Stall near Zhongshan Road. It was a great idea with zero complaints. What’s more, we were on sale at Jack and Jones, with 50% off the entire store. It felt like it was an unprecedented bargain, and my husband also left with a full load, haha ~ When you return to the hotel, you can go to the open-air swimming pool to relieve the fatigue of the day. The super nice swimming pool is open to guests for free and there is also a gym. After washing up at night, I can eat mangoes in the room and watch the European Cup ~ Forgive me for understanding this. It can’t match the freshness of Xiamen, but Tongcheng will send text message reminders throughout the entire journey, and the complimentary airport pick-up service is very considerate.

2098,2098,"What do you say? Let’s start with basic necessities, food, housing and transportation. Since this is my first time traveling independently, I don’t know anything. Now let’s talk about my trip to Xiamen. I went there from February 19th to February 22nd. Although I only played for a few days, it was not enough. It's almost the same. It's been very warm during the day these days. In the morning I wore a short-sleeved jacket and a 7-quarter-sleeved jacket and it felt just right. It's just that the wind blows a little cold at night, so I just need to bring a long-sleeved jacket. Let's talk about it. Eat it, I am from Sichuan and I like spicy food, while Xiamen food is relatively bland, either sour or sweet. Personally, I remember that it is acceptable and I can try new things. If my boyfriend doesn’t like it, I will eat it along the way. All of them are complaints, but there is one good restaurant called ""Little Glasses Food Stall"" that tastes pretty good. I like their mango juice. It's delicious, the seafood doesn't smell fishy, ​​and the price is not expensive. There is one diagonally opposite the Little Glasses Food Stall. There are many local people buying food in many small alleys who recommended a restaurant called ""Jiawei Tianxiang"". I don't remember well, but it seems to be quite famous there. But I don't think it is very good. If you eat there, then Go ahead and turn left at the first intersection. There is an old lady selling steamed buns and pig heart soup that is very delicious. There is also a restaurant opposite the hotel called Four Seasons Hot Pot. It is a Hong Kong tea restaurant and the taste is pretty good. There are also restaurants in Xiamen that seem to be the best. Toilet paper is not provided. Although it is sold, it is still convenient to bring. Now I have to give the hotel 32 likes. I originally chose an international five-star hotel at that time, but it was no longer available and I can only choose this one. But it is really good, the service attitude is good, and the environment is good. , the food is okay, the other service attitude in Xiamen is really not good, no matter high-end or low-end, the scenic spots in this hotel are not very far, if possible, you can choose the bus which is more convenient, you can find some change and eat snacks when you go For the glasses food stall, just take the 31 bus in front of the hotel to the pier. If you take a taxi, it is best to order in front of the bus stop, otherwise the driver may not pick you up. The traffic seems to be strict. Go to Shan Fort, Huanhai Road, Xiamen University Just take the 88 bus from the hotel entrance to the first pier and then take the No. 2 bus. The service attitude on the same journey is very good. They will remind you when your flight is. Someone will contact you the night before to ask what time the flight is to pick you up on time. Someone will also contact you the night before you come back, which is very convenient. I will choose Tongcheng from now on. Awesome",Postive

The price increased but the children sat by the window. You can see the blue sky and white clouds from the location, which is worth it! Since we were running out of time when arriving at the airport, we requested that children be seated together with adults. The ground staff at Hongqiao Airport were impatient and did not arrange seats together. However, we met a kind person on the plane and adjusted the seats. ! The ground staff at Gaoqi Airport on our return trip were very good. Not only did they patiently arrange the flight, but they also carefully reminded us of the many things to do when boarding our children. They helped us arrange the front row of the economy class cabin, which was just one aisle away from the first class cabin. There was such a gap in service! Hotel: During the peak travel period, the waiting time for hotel room check-in is quite long. Compared with the hotels of this level that I have stayed in, the room size is not large, and it is very crowded for two adults and two children (the hotel stipulates that children cannot be counted as heads, so book two rooms Need to pay the difference)!

2100,2100,"After getting off the plane, we took a taxi to the hotel. The taxi fare was 38 yuan. The hotel deposit was 500 yuan. It was originally estimated to be 1,000 yuan. It depends on me and two girls. There are buses at the entrance of Zhongshan Road at the first stop. All buses in Xiamen cost 1 yuan and 0.50 cents. We left the hotel at 6 o'clock and finished shopping. We had too much to eat at 11 o'clock when we got back from Zhongshan Road. The taxi back from Zhongshan Road cost 11.5 yuan at night. The next morning, we had breakfast on the 3rd floor. There were not many varieties. I recommend eating noodles, which are more delicious. The rest is just like this. Then we set off to the Railway Culture Park. Don’t go there. I was deceived by the photos. The second stop was Cat Street, a short street near Xiamen University where the cats are very cute. The third stop was Baicheng Beach. Remember to bring slippers. Don’t bring slippers and sunglasses because it rains in Xiamen. You will regret it. You can't understand the weather in Xiamen. It rained for 10 minutes and then the sun rained again for 20 minutes. The fourth stop was Zengcuo'an. I ate the specialty I bought there. 2 boxes of mangoes 80. I bought 8 boxes and sent them back. People also had vegetarian cakes and then went back to the hotel. Then the next day it was breakfast again at the hotel. Then the Gulangyu Island boat ticket** was booked for 35 yuan for a round trip. Just swipe your ID card. Gulangyu Island is big or small. You can eat on foot. There are many, but the queues at the specialty shops last for at least half an hour. And then there’s that bamboo shoot jelly, don’t eat it. It’s just like jelly with bugs inside and it’s served with mustard. I couldn’t get used to it and I vomited after eating just one. I had breakfast on the fourth day and packed my bags to go to the airport. Then the flight was delayed for an hour. It rained heavily in Shanghai and there was traffic control. The Spring Airlines I chose was just like taking the green train. I was drunk and sold stuff on it, so I had to queue at the counter to get tickets. In general, there was a person named Pan Xingxing at the front desk of the hotel. He is so handsome and I want him so much. I didn’t have the courage to book a hotel ticket on the day I left. I only needed 1,000 to have fun in Xiamen. But I spent a lot of money to buy things I liked and there were things in the hotel refrigerator that cost money. I ate them.

We stayed at the Pan Pacific five-star hotel, which is at most a 10-minute walk from Xiagu Pier. It is very convenient to go to Gulangyu Island. The outdoor swimming pool in the hotel is great, and the gym is free for hotel guests.

You can also get there by bus for 2 yuan. It’s up to you to choose. We visited Zhongshan Road, Xiamen University, and the food street in the afternoon on the first day, went to Gulangyu Sunlight Rock on the second day, and cycled at the Xiamen Botanical Garden, Huli Mountain Fort, and Huandao Road on the third day. I was tired and happy along the way. What impressed me the most was some specialty shops and snacks on Zhongshan Road. They are so beautiful that you can’t miss them, haha.

Fortunately, the driver responded quickly, otherwise he would have been rear-ended. The hotel is very easy to find, about 25 minutes away from the airport. Xiagu Pier is a 15-minute walk and two bus stops away. <br>Taking an Uber from the hotel to Nanputuo Temple only costs 15 yuan. It is not recommended to take the bus because the buses in Xiamen are really bad. Going out in this kind of weather will make you hot. Xiamen University is right in Nanputuo. Next door to the temple, there is no limit to the number of people and time to visit on Saturdays and Sundays. In fact, there is not much inside. It is just relatively old and the things are very expensive. It is not recommended to shop or eat there. <br>Just outside Xiamen University is Baicheng Beach. The water is very clean and people are cleaning it all the time. There are also yachts and other things you can ride on. It is recommended to rent a bicycle. It costs 10 yuan an hour. You can negotiate the price with the boss. You can also ride on a bicycle. Riding to Zengjuan, the water there is better and clearer. <br>I went to Gulangyu Island the next day. The hotel I arranged was very close to Neikuao Pier, a five-minute walk. The overall consumption on the island was very high, and the water quality was not as clean as Xiamen Baicheng Beach. It was too hot and I couldn’t go out at all. Go to the door, so most of the time the air conditioning is blowing in the hotel. <br>The flight took off at 9pm on the third day. We took a boat back from Gulangyu Island and then went to SM Plaza to eat. After that, we went to Zhongpu Fruit Wholesale Market to buy fruit. Mangoes are super cheap and very delicious.

I went to Tongcheng.com and found that its free travel products include air tickets and hotels, which are better than my own. Booking is much more convenient and cost-effective. When we were debating whether to stay in Gulangyu for one night, customer service Gillian kindly reminded us that some parts of Gulangyu were under construction and would be noisy, so we chose to stay in the same hotel for three nights, haha, lazy people. <br>Let’s talk about the hotel first: the five-star Sheraton, the accommodation is definitely comfortable, including three breakfasts, it’s great, the Sheraton is actually a wealthy person with a golden appearance, it is indeed wealthy enough, and the hotel waiters are also very conscientious. As soon as I saw the car Outside the hotel, they hurriedly helped us open the door and get our luggage. The traffic in Xiamen is terrible and the traffic jams are severe. In this regard, Sheraton's geographical advantage is not as good as that of Zengcuo'an Zhongshan Road, but it is absolutely quiet and comfortable. . <br>Let’s talk about the itinerary: On the night we arrived at the hotel, we went to Zhongshan Road to taste Xiamen’s special snacks. The bamboo shoot jelly was a bit heavy, and the Huang Zehe peanut soup was really delicious. However, only the peanut soup tasted good. Noriwa's five-flower roll tea noodles are average. The Zui No. 1 food stall on Dianping is indeed well-deserved and very cost-effective, especially the sixty-year-old food. I have never tasted such a filling haha, and the taste is great. <br>After a night of wandering, I set out early the next morning to go to the Botanical Garden. It is worth a visit. Buy a ticket for the sightseeing bus and go around the three districts. We wandered around the fairyland-like rainforest area and saw several couples taking wedding photos. **When it’s foggy, the rainforest area is really beautiful! Later, for some reason, we walked around to the flora area. When we saw the group of companions who got on the bus leisurely got off the bus and arrived at the Sa Sang area, we felt so sad. However, the frangipani flowers are as beautiful as those in Thailand. I also saw the adult version of the cute and meaty people inside. They looked so ferocious haha. In the end, I couldn’t walk in the National Defense Area. I didn’t go to see much before going to Xiamen University. Xiamen University has to queue up to enter on non-weekends. Let’s check the time. In the morning, after having a meal, we went to Nanputuo first. I have to say that the public toilets in Xiamen scenic spots are very clean and well managed in this regard. I arrived at Xiamen University before two o'clock, but was told that the two o'clock batch was also full. I later paid 20 yuan to find a scalper to get in. Xiamen University is well-deserved, it is big and beautiful. We walked all the way from Xiamen University to the seaside, rented a two-person bicycle, and rode to Zengcuo'an. Zengcuo'an was crowded with people. In addition to eating snacks, we also bought some gadgets and local products. Lin's fish balls and duck are indeed delicious, but the shrimps and eggs are not delicious. We didn't buy the seafood grilled outside. After all, it is too unhygienic to bite flies. It happened to be five or six when we wanted to go back. There was a huge traffic jam and we couldn't get a taxi, so we went to Two Tomatoes near Xiamen University to have dinner and took a black taxi back to the hotel. <br>On the third day, Gulangyu Island, I bought the ferry ticket one day in advance.

After searching for a long time on the same journey, I finally decided to go. The journey to Xiamen proved to be worth it. <br>Transportation: The early flight is quite hard, but who told us to go there for fun? No matter how hard it is, it is worth it ~ The plane took off on time and everything went smoothly. We were very satisfied with the considerate pick-up and drop-off service on the same journey as soon as we got off the plane. After all, it’s always good to have someone to guide you when you first come to a city~<br>Accommodation: I arrived at the Pan Pacific Hotel smoothly after 11 o’clock. The room was still being cleaned. The staff asked if I needed to upgrade to a deluxe room. I felt that the price difference was acceptable and I readily agreed. The hotel room was great. The space is very large and the facilities are complete. The most important thing is that there is a big bathtub. For the next three days, the little friends played in it every day and were reluctant to come out. I feel that this room is really worth it. I will definitely choose to stay in the hotel again next time I have the opportunity to work. The staff are also very nice. From the service staff in the lobby to the check-in staff at the front desk and the waiters in the buffet restaurant, they all have great attitudes and make you feel at home~<br>Buffet: The hotel's buffet breakfast is well-deserved. Every morning, I eat delicious dishes that are updated every day. I feel really attentive to it. The variety of fruits is very rich. I have a fruit dinner every day. In short, it is very satisfying and very good~<br> Journey: If you come to Xiamen, Gulangyu Island , Xiamen University, White Beach, Zengcuo'an, and Zhongshan Road are all must-see attractions. It's just that it's hard to exhaust them all with our little friends. Although we went to them all, we didn't browse them all, but we were very happy in the end. .

2106,2106,"I saw that the self-guided tour on the same journey was quite cost-effective, so I placed the order half a month in advance. Tongcheng's service is very good, there is a dedicated person calling to confirm the itinerary. Overall, I'm satisfied. Let’s talk about the itinerary. I almost slept on the flight on the morning of the 2nd. I rushed to the airport before it was late. Air China’s service was very good. However, friends who want to travel should book their tickets at noon. I personally think it is too late to leave early in the morning. I stayed at Wyndham for the first two nights. The hotel facilities and services are great. The only drawback is that it is not convenient to travel in Haicang District. Fortunately, there is a ferry during the day. If it is after 6:30 at night, you can only take a taxi and go around. On the third night, I upgraded to Sheraton. I smelled a strange smell as soon as I entered the room. I thought it was because I had just finished cleaning. However, I was still very heavy when I came back at night. I didn't even mention changing rooms. Anyway, it was just the second night. I left for a while to make ends meet. Overall, I feel it is not as good as Wyndham, after all, it is old. The advantage of free travel is that you can arrange it as you like, and the service on the same trip is great. I had a rough time in Xiamen this time, and I will come again next time. Of course, Tongcheng is the first choice for independent travel.",Postive

Due to weather reasons, our flight was delayed for ten hours. During this process, Tongcheng customer service kept communicating with us and comforted us. After arriving in Xiamen, they helped us communicate with the hotel about the delay. The one-night stay also helped us coordinate with the airline to change the flight, allowing us to maintain a happy traveling mood after the flight was delayed for such a long time. In addition, Tongcheng also actively helped us apply for delay insurance compensation. Here, I Thank you very much Tongcheng! Secondly, since I chose to travel independently with children, the whole itinerary was arranged very easily. On the first day, I went to South Putuo in the afternoon and went shopping on Zhongshan Road in the evening. On the second day, I rode a battery car around the island, watching the sea and playing on the beach. Baicheng Beach was crowded and a bit crowded. It was dirty, so we chose a cleaner beach a little further away to play in the sea. The children were very happy. In the afternoon, we went to Zengcuo'an to eat some special snacks, and then went to the island in the evening. On the third day, we played on the island, but there were no There are very few cars, bicycles and electric cars. There are only sightseeing electric cars. It costs 50 per person to go around the island. Children under 1.2 meters are free of charge. There are many specialty restaurants on the island, which are inconspicuous in appearance, but very exquisite. We went to one The western restaurant tastes very good and has resident singers, which is a great surprise! Let’s talk about accommodation. The environment of Pantai Hotel is very good, and the buffet breakfast is very rich. Since we arrived late and there were no ordinary rooms, they upgraded us to an apartment room with all kinds of facilities, including a kitchen, a washing machine and drying machine. Very pleasant surprise! The hotel environment on the island is also good. The breakfast is a little simple, but there is a swimming pool in front of the room. The children are very happy!

After getting off the plane, a tour guide picked us up, and then the driver took us to the center of the ferry terminal. It only took about half an hour from the airport to the terminal, because I bought a ticket for the 4:50 ferry at ** in advance. After waiting for half an hour, I swiped my ID card. Went in, very convenient. We sat at Neicuoao Pier, which is relatively close to the hotel. The hotel does not provide pick-up and drop-off, so we had to walk to the hotel for about ten minutes. The environment of Gulang Villa Hotel is good, with an outdoor swimming pool. The front desk upgraded the sea view room to a 2-meter king bed with children. , otherwise I really wouldn’t be able to live there, which is very good. The only drawback is that it is a bit far from the scenic spots and pedestrian streets. It is not convenient to bring children. You have to walk a long way to find delicious food. The breakfast is very average. To get to the scenic spots, it is best to go to Neicuoao Pier and take a sightseeing bus. It costs 50 yuan per person and can circle the island. Stop at Shuzhuang Garden in the middle, and then go to Sanqiutian Pier. Ocean World and Snack Pedestrian Street are both nearby. I stayed in Gulangyu Island for two nights, and then returned to Xiamen from Neicuoao. I took a taxi to the Powerlong Pullman Hotel, which cost about 20 yuan. Although it was said to be a five-star hotel, the service was not up to par. There was no service staff to guide me after I checked in. For picking up luggage, it is better to stay at Gulang Villa Hotel. The room I checked in at the beginning had a very strong paint smell. I called the front desk and was quickly resolved and asked to change rooms. The hotel should be in a development area and the environment is good, but it is still a problem. It is inconvenient to eat. There is a bus stop sign at the door of the hotel. The child really didn't want to squeeze in, so he directly called Didi Express, which was really convenient. The breakfast at Bonhams Pullman is much richer than that at Gulang Villa, and it is served until half past ten. The return flight was at 4 p.m., and the drop-off driver gave us the information in advance. We arrived at the hotel on time and at the airport at 1:30. The service was very good, but the plane was delayed by two hours, and it was almost 9 o'clock when we arrived in Jinan.

The beach was still so beautiful, the snacks in Zengcuo’an were still so delicious, and the beach on Gulangyu Island was still so dirty, haha. Now let’s talk about the hotel. The hotel service is very good. We arrived early and the hotel still checked in a room for us in advance, but the reservation was only found for one room. Later I found out that their reservation department made the reservation. The lobby is nice and there is In the rest area, there are still people singing, but there is a charge. In addition, there is a service fee of 10% + 6% tax. Tax? This is the first time I paid separately in China. Aren’t the taxes in our country included in the goods? Maybe it’s because it’s an international hotel. Let’s talk about the rooms. The size of the rooms is amazingly small. It’s not much bigger than a home. It’s a five-star hotel. The decoration is relatively old. One of the rooms is so small that there is almost no cold water. However, it was repaired the next day. It’s the second best. Oh my God. When I reported it for repair, the waiter said I could wash my face in the bathtub. I was drunk too, so it was my fault that I couldn't wash my face in the basin. I won’t say anything about the cobwebs in the room. The breakfast is good, but visually it is not worth 158/person, but the variety is okay and the taste is good. What I want to say is that the hotel is surrounded by affluent areas, and there are quite a lot of luxury cars. R8 i8 GTR can be seen everywhere on the roadside.

If you don’t have high requirements for airplane food, this is definitely a perfect trip. On the day of arrival, we checked into the Sheraton, took a good rest and refreshed ourselves. We headed to Gulangyu Island early the next morning. We took a family walk on the ancient streets of the island and lived a slow-paced life. It was very pleasant, especially for professionals who could calm down. Try Gulangyu's seafood and snacks, sit down quietly with a cup of coffee and give your busy soul a short vacation. The small island of Gulangyu Island is not very big. There are two piers, and it only takes 20 minutes to walk between them. If you just walk around, you can see the spring scenery. Gulangyu Island has very convenient transportation in Xiamen, and the round-trip ferry ticket is 35 yuan/person. Moreover, the ticket is valid for 20 days. If you have enough time, you can stay on Gulangyu Island for 2 days, which is definitely the finishing touch of the spiritual journey.

After arriving on the first day, we went to Xiamen University and Nan Putuo. I bought vegetarian cakes from Nan Putuo. I also went to Xiamen University to buy a series of souvenirs such as commemorative medals and fans. Then I went back to the hotel to the fifth floor. Work out in the gym and go to the pier in the evening. The next day I went to Zengcuo'an and Coastal Avenue and rented bicycles for riding. It was a good time to ride a tandem bicycle with my lover while enjoying the sea breeze in the hot summer weather. Zengcuo'an is still very close to the Huli Mountain Fortress, so we can go together.

It was a double room, but I looked at most 1.6 meters, not 1.8 meters. It was a bit crowded for our family of three. The hotel is old after all. It's a hotel, so the hardware is average. The advantage is that it is close to the city, McDonald's is right outside the door, and it is convenient to eat, drink and have fun. Xiamen has serious traffic jams, but everything else is fine.

When I arrived at Xiamen University, there were many people saying it was for sightseeing. The car, all private cars, cost 100 yuan to tour Xiamen University and 100 yuan to travel around the island.

There is a swimming pool on the 3rd floor of the hotel. The environment is very good. On the fourth day, I had to go back to the hotel, so I went to bed a little late. After breakfast, I checked out at noon and took a taxi. Let’s go to Zengcuo’an, a small fishing village in the past. It’s economical to shop and eat! Tongcheng Xiaoli's service is attentive, and the hotel's breakfast environment and location are very good!",Postive
2123,2123,"I have always booked my travels online with Tongcheng. The difference this time is that there is a travel specialist to help you book. During this period, he will help you solve all your problems. The service attitude is very good. Thank you Tang Kai. However, the customer service on Tongcheng is also unreliable. Regarding the matter, the group departure notice was also sent out incorrectly. Fortunately, I found out in time and asked the specialist Xiao Tang to help me solve it. Let’s talk about the hotel. The hotel in Gulangyu Island is very close to the pier. It takes 3 minutes to get there. There is a beach right outside the door. There are two restaurants at the door. But the room is not that good. I wanted to upgrade my room and they asked me to call Tongcheng to solve it. I can't even pay directly, it's too cliché. Breakfast was ok. There are not many tricks, but they are cheap. Children only added 25 yuan. After Gulangyu introduced me to the hotel in Xiamen, it was different. The environment was elegant and the air was fresh. It was next to the park. I upgraded to a lake view room. The room was arranged in the square of the park. When I opened the curtains, I could see the panoramic view of Bailuzhou Park. It was super Beautiful, but I have to remind everyone not to book a day trip with a group at the hotel. It is super expensive and will kill you. When I went to Xiamen University this time, I met a special car. The person was super nice. He will take you to play for 300 yuan a day. You can visit Xiamen's scenic spots in a Buick Business Car, just you and no one else. Attractions include: Music Square, Beach, Dadeng Island, Kinmen Former Site, Xiamen University, and South Putuo. If you want to go somewhere, he will also take you there. Tickets are at your own expense, but I found that few attractions in Xiamen require tickets. There is a long queue at Xiamen University, but if you follow him, you don’t have to queue. He will take you there and tell you about Xiamen’s features and attractions along the way. I met two distinguished people during this trip to Xiamen. One was Tang Kai, the commissioner on the same trip, and the other was this driver. Thank you!",Postive
2124,2124,"I made a customized trip to Guiyang and Xiamen at Tongcheng's physical store. I upgraded the hotel. Although there were some hiccups, Tongcheng solved it quickly. I like it from the bottom of my heart. I stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Xiamen city. The location is far away from Zhongshan Road and very close to Xiagu Pier. It takes less than 10 minutes to walk. You can see the sea from the window position. Unfortunately, it is foggy during the Qingming Festival. The hotel's buffet breakfast is very good. The Four Seasons Spring Hotel where I stayed on Gulangyu Island was not very cost-effective. The so-called sea view was completely blocked by the honey locust tree in front of the hotel. I could not see the sea at all. It was only very close to Neicuoao Pier, but it was far from the bustling island. Longtou Road is a bit far. The beach on Gulangyu Island has been ruined by tourists so much that I can't bear to look at it. It's so dirty... Unfortunately, Gulangyu Island is in the process of applying for World Heritage status at this time. Roads are being built everywhere, and shop fronts have been renovated in a mess. It won't be completed until June 30. Generally speaking, Xiamen is still a good city suitable for leisure and relaxation, and the quality and efficiency of Tongcheng are unparalleled.",Postive

The flight arrived at Xiamen Gaoqi Airport in the morning. Then take the airport bus to Dongdu Pier. I bought a ferry ticket to Gulangyu Island (it’s best to buy it first, but you need to do it one hour in advance). Arrive at Gulangyu Island and stay at Four Seasons Hotel. The hotel is clean and tidy. It's conveniently located near the pier. After checking in, we found a restaurant nearby for lunch. Seafood is cheap, vegetables are not. After the meal, I took a walk along the seaside and it felt very good. At about four o'clock, we went back to the hotel and rested for a while. Then we visited the night market in Gulangyu Island and ate snacks. It tastes good and the fruit is delicious too. <br>The next day. Continue to visit Gulangyu Island, eat snacks and buy specialties. Take the ferry back to Xiamen in the evening. It is difficult to take a taxi in Xiamen. Finally, I called the No. 1 bus. Check into Xiamen Sheraton Hotel. Nice hotel. <br>The third day: After breakfast, we went to Aoyuan (Tan Kah Kee Memorial Hall), walked around for lunch, and then went to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street to shop, eat and have fun. Very pleasant. <br>Day 4: Visited the famous Xiamen University. It really lives up to its name and is very artistic. Then we went to Nanputuo Temple, walked around, lit incense and prayed for blessings. Finally, we went to Zhongshan Road to buy snacks and returned to the hotel. <br>No itinerary was arranged on the fifth day because I had a baby.

2126,2126,"The trip to Xiamen has been planned for a long time and finally took shape. The choice of Tongcheng was as good as ever. I stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel for four nights, a five-star hotel. The hotel environment is very good. The waiters are very attentive and will take the initiative to help. You take your luggage, and the hotel's breakfast buffet is also rich in variety. Across the overpass from the hotel is the famous Chaofu City Restaurant. The food inside is delicious. I recommend the crispy squab. The price is a bit expensive, but the food is very exquisite. In terms of itinerary, the train arrived in Xiamen on the first day, and there was a special car to pick up and drop off. Although the car was relatively worn, it was still very convenient to have a car to pick up. It is best to contact the driver an hour in advance, otherwise you will have to wait for the bus when you arrive at the station. In the evening, I went to Chaofucheng to eat . The next day at Nanputuo Temple, I had a vegetarian meal at noon and bought vegetarian cakes. Then I went to Xiamen University, which is very close. After visiting Xiamen University, I went directly to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street to eat snacks. It was very lively. On the third day of Gulangyu Island, you can buy the ferry ticket to the island in advance on the Internet, otherwise you have to queue up to buy it on the spot. It rained lightly that day, but it was not very hot. I walked around the island for more than five hours and ate a lot of snacks and fish balls. It's very authentic. I drank Malasan juice. It was very delicious. It's all pure juice. I also bought a souvenir from Ms. Zhao. There were so many people on the outlying island. We went to queue at around 3 o'clock and waited for an hour before boarding the boat. , I went to eat at the small glasses food stall in the evening. It was really good quality and cheap, very good! On the fourth day, I went to the Xiamen Botanical Garden. The ticket cost 40 per ticket. It was very big inside and the sun was very bright. Fortunately, there were many trees inside, so I felt the ticket was worth it. Depart Xiamen on the fifth day. In short, the tourist city of Xiamen is still worth visiting. It is recommended to choose a self-guided tour on the same journey. The price/performance ratio is still very high!",Postive
2127,2127,"There is nothing to criticize about this trip. OK: I paid extra to change the flight to a suitable time, although the return trip was delayed... Accommodation: Pearlman in Xiamen. When I checked in, the front desk said that there was no information about us, so I made a few calls to contact Tongcheng, and it was about It took forty minutes to wait in the lobby and it was resolved. The Pearlman mattress is very comfortable to sleep on. Living in Gulangyu Island is like spring all year round. Apart from being close to the pier, this hotel has no other outstanding advantages. The green environment is good, but the facilities in the room are old, there are mold spots, and the mattress is not comfortable to sleep on. After going to Xiamen and Gulangyu Island, I realized that this kind of travel destination is not my favorite. The food was average, Huang Zehe, and the Shacha noodles were not to our taste. We almost stopped after two bites. The 1980 meat dumplings were okay, but they had some sweet and spicy sauce added to them, so we finished them anyway. I thought Xiamen should be delicious because of its proximity to tropical fruits, but this is not the case. I didn’t get any delicious mangoes. The signature mango cup of Malasang on Gulangyu Island is actually squeezed mango juice on the lower layer and fresh-cut mango sandwiched with cream on the upper layer. The cream destroys the original taste of the mango. The taste of seafood is not that good either. The food stall I found in Xiamen based on Dianping’s reviews was okay, but the food stall on Gulangyu Island was expensive and unpalatable. The one with a good mood was more expensive and the taste was ok, but you can’t eat the mood again and again, right? Gulangyu was under renovation, and when it came to Xiao Ma Ge Cheese, it was so noisy that it was almost untenable. Attractions: Xiamen University, Furong Tunnel, the fresh style is quite strong, the photos taken are not as good as those on the Internet, the sea on Gulangyu Island is so-so... In short, the attractions are good. Maybe I’ve seen too much of Xiamen, maybe we’re past the age of Xiaoxing, so the attractions are useless to me, and since the food is not good, Xiamen is something I won’t recommend to people around me. Travel point. Another note: There are so many mosquitoes in Xiamen that they are very poisonous! The biggest bite I got was as big as a big lychee, itchy and swollen! Be sure to bring mosquito repellent when you go to Xiamen!",Postive
2128,2128,"Recommend Wyndham Hotel, both the service attitude and environmental sanitation are excellent! The five-star hotels in the city are not as good as Wyndham. The only drawback is that it is not very convenient to travel, and you have to wait for a long time to take the boat! The next day I spent extra money to upgrade to the Gulangyu Hotel, Panruo Holiday Inn, which is very close to the Neicuoao Pier. I think this is the only advantage. The environmental hygiene is average. As shown in the picture of the quilt, the pieces of cotton are clearly visible. The air conditioner is broken. I contacted the customer service at the front desk and arranged for a master to repair it. The master adjusted the temperature a few times and set it to 30 degrees. It turned out to be 19.5 degrees all night! Not counting this, the room was full of small mosquitoes. The waiter said that there was mosquito coil, which was very useful, but it turned out that the mosquitoes had a full meal all night long! The old man fell ill because of this. After a miserable night, he decided to check out in the morning! I stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel on the third day, which was a little inferior to the Wyndham I stayed at on the first night! The service attitude is not as good as Wyndham! We checked in at noon and didn't go a day. The old man was not feeling well and slept all day, which disrupted all our travel plans! Very disappointed! The only thing I am satisfied with is the service attitude of Ms. Tao, the customer service staff of Tongcheng. I am very satisfied and will come back to her next time I travel!

2129,2129,"I arrived at Xiamen Airport at noon on the first day. According to the text message, it said that someone was coming to pick me up. When I arrived at the meeting place, I still didn’t see the person picking me up. I could only call to inquire, and then asked me to give the phone number to Airport Express. In the end, the ticket seller directly took the airport bus to the pier. In fact, it was an agreement between the local government and the airport bus. In the end, even the airport bus service staff couldn't stand it anymore and complained to the people next to them. Now no one comes. , I called directly to confirm. It was too lazy. Anyway, I was a little dissatisfied with this pick-up. When I arrived at the pier, I directly used the ticket I bought online to board the ship. However, the child’s ticket still had to be printed at the ticket window. It only takes 20 minutes to reach Gulangyu Island. The Four Seasons Hotel is very close to Neicuoao Pier, and it only takes two minutes to walk from the pier. The hotel environment is quite good, but Gulangyu Island is currently under construction everywhere, so there is no need to spend two days there, so we rushed to the city at noon the next day, and took a taxi directly to the Sheraton Hotel. The hotel is indeed high-end, but it is the only one. The only downfall is the location. The hotel is too far away from all the scenic spots, too far, too far. Important things have to be said three times. Also, although the breakfast buffet is free, there are only two breakfast coupons per room. , the child will have to spend nearly 70 yuan in addition, which is a bit annoying. If you are not short of money, just spend money to take the child to eat. Our whole family only ate on the first day, and the children and mother ate after that. I ate something outside. I arrived at the hotel in the afternoon and took my kids to swim in the hotel swimming pool. In the evening I ate something at the nearby SM Plaza. On the third day, I went to Xiamen University, Nan Putuo and Baicheng Beach. The bus took nearly an hour to arrive. Take the 959 bus at Lucuo North Station to the South Gate of Xiamen University (terminal station). You must get off at Xiamen University South Gate or Xiamen University West Village Station. Only these two gates allow tourists to enter. No map required. If you buy it, a free map will be distributed when you enter the school gate. There are many people who say they can take you into the campus without queuing. It costs 10 yuan per person. Don't let them take them. In fact, they will take you to the front to jump in line. It's too **. Xiamen University is indeed beautiful and worth a visit, but don’t go to the Furong Restaurant, it’s not that unpalatable. Coming out of the west gate of Xiamen University is Baicheng Beach. Baicheng Beach feels average, there are too many people, and it is not very clean. In fact, the more beautiful beaches are on the road around the island. After playing at Baicheng Beach, I went to Hulishan Fort to watch the show, and finally went to Zhongshan Road. Have a snack. On the fourth day, I decided to take a taxi directly to Zengcuo'an. It took about half an hour to get there. The taxi cost about 35 yuan. There wasn't much to see in Zengcuo'an. It was just snacks. It was over in an hour, and then I rented an electric car. , 40 an hour, 150 a day, I bargained to 125 a day, and later found out that renting an electric bike is wise. There are too many downhills on the road around the island, and it’s really hard to ride without any physical strength. Electric bikes are 10 yuan more expensive than bicycles. Still quite worthwhile. The road around the island is indeed beautiful. There is the sea all the way. When you see the beautiful beach, you can go down and take photos. It is very pleasant. In the evening, we had seafood in Zengcuo'an and then returned to the hotel. On the fifth day, the driver would come to take us to the airport and the trip was over.",Postive

The Pan Pacific Hotel has convenient transportation, and the bus stop is right outside the door. There is an outdoor swimming pool in the hotel. My son must go there every day. There are many foreigners. The breakfast is quite rich. On the first day I went to Gulangyu Island, I first went to the cruise terminal and found that there were so many people. Even if I bought a ticket, I still had to wait for almost 2 hours to get on the ship. I recommend that you go to another terminal - Neicuo Pier (it seems to be called this) , if you are interested, you can check it online), it is a bit far away, but there are few people at the pier and the boat ride time is also short. The Little Glasses Seafood Food Stall recommended online is economical and very crowded. When I got there late, some of the seafood was sold out. The next day we went to Tulou and Yunshuiyao. Because there were so many people there, we rented a commercial vehicle and spent 4-5 hours on the way back and forth, eating farm food. On the third day, I went to Xiamen University and complained that there were too many people in the cafeteria. Overall, this trip was not bad, but the weather was too hot.

You could also swim in the open-air swimming pool in the evening if you have nothing to do. I usually consider going with a group first, but this time I considered taking a group with children. I was afraid of being tired, so I chose to travel independently. Generally speaking, I made the right choice this time by choosing the same journey. I read the guide a little before going. The bus station is on the right side of the hotel entrance. Taking a taxi is also very convenient. First of all, We went to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street one day. Because we flew there in the afternoon, we didn’t have much time to go shopping. After having a meal, we went back to the hotel to rest. The next day we went to Zengcuo’an, where we visited the food street and enjoyed the shopping. You can rent a bicycle and ride along the coast on the road around the island. Since it was raining that day, I went to the food street and had something to eat before returning. I slept in the hotel in the afternoon and went to a hot pot restaurant near the hotel in the evening. On the third day, it was very convenient to grab a boat ticket at 7 o'clock in the morning. If you can't get it on the **, you can't buy it on site. I chose the 10:50 boat to Gulangyu Island. The island is not very popular. It’s a big place, but there is no transportation, so I have to walk. I bought a map but I didn’t understand it, so it’s more reliable to navigate on my mobile phone. I originally wanted to go to Sunlight Rock or something, but my kids wanted to see Ocean Water World, so I went there. Along the way Many streets are like old alleys, with small shops next to each other. It’s good to walk around. If you have the chance, you should stay on the island for one night, because there is not enough shopping in one day. There are many places in Gulangyu We came back before even reaching the scenic spots. On the fourth day, it rained heavily again. I packed my luggage and held my children early in the morning as if I were fleeing. I originally planned to stop at Xiamen University as my last stop, but because of the heavy rain, I thought about it and gave up. Well, I took a taxi to Zhongshan Road and bought souvenirs, pearl bracelets, durian cakes, pineapple cakes, etc. I had to take something back with me after all. I also visited the mall and found a women’s clothing store. The clothes are of good style and not expensive. They only cost over 100 yuan. I bought two of them. I had clam vermicelli at the food court for lunch. It tasted great. I ate and did some shopping. The four-day trip was over. , the only shortcoming is that it always rains, or rains heavily, and I have to hold an umbrella with my child in my arms, making me wet and uncomfortable wherever I play.

Especially the return flight booked with Hebei Airlines, I had to wait in the cabin for more than an hour after boarding! On the first day I went to Gulangyu Island, I paid attention to the tickets booked by Xiamen Ferry No. ** in advance, swiped my ID card and boarded the ship directly.

I originally planned to go to three places the next day, Baicheng Beach, Xiamen University and Zengcuo'an. However, the children lingered on the beach and we didn't go to Zengcuo'an in the end. Xiamen University can enter from 12:00 to 2:00 from Monday to Friday, and can enter after 5:00 pm. Entry is not allowed at other times. No limit on Saturdays and Sundays. There are many people queuing up at noon, and there are many locals who offer to pay 10 yuan to let you in, so don’t take the bait! In fact, it’s just a matter of taking it to the front and jumping in line halfway! ! In fact, I got in after queuing for a while, and the speed was pretty good. The sand at Baicheng Beach is very fine, there are many people, and the toilets are the kind of mobile vehicles with heavy queues. Diapers are still recommended for small children. The Little Glasses seafood stall is very popular. It’s cheap, good quality, fast, and the environment is okay. I ordered clams, clams, shrimps, mushrooms, pineapple pancakes, vegetables, and some meat. I forgot the name. It only cost less than 150 yuan. The shrimp mushrooms are also called pippi. The shrimps, or shrimps, salt and pepper are great, but the only drawback is that they are a bit small. The various delicacies on Zhongshan Road are worth a visit for foodies! !

We will book again on the same trip in the future. Let’s talk about the wonderful itinerary that made us linger. The first stop is Gulangyu Island, which we have dreamed of. In the past, we have always heard from friends that Gulangyu Island is so beautiful, but generally we can’t find it. This time we made Gulangyu Island the first stop of our trip. When I walked into Gulangyu Island, my first impression was that the people on the island are very laid-back and have opened many romantic-style shops. The piano museum on the island is particularly beautiful, as are the churches and villas. The alley inside is deep, full of classical atmosphere, and has a romantic atmosphere. Seafood is very cheap, so it’s best to avoid going during holidays. The island has a pleasant climate like spring all year round, without the hustle and bustle of cars and horses, and with the singing of birds and the fragrance of flowers, it is known as a sea garden. The island has well preserved many buildings with various Chinese and foreign architectural styles, including traditional Chinese temples with cornices, small and exquisite Japanese houses, and the original consulates of Western countries in the 19th century European style. The night on Gulangyu Island looks elegant and quiet. After the construction of the night view project, the Sunlight Rock representing the natural scene, the Bagua Tower representing the exotic architectural style, the piano-shaped waiting hall representing the Music Island, and the statue of Zheng Chenggong standing on the Fuding Rock are reflected in various lights. The bottom is transparent, bright and shining. Standing on Zhongshan Road in Xiamen across the river, you can see the night view of Gulangyu Island. The neon lights of Zhongshan Road, the spotlights of high-rise buildings and many colorful spotlights complement each other and shine dazzlingly. If you are lucky enough to come to Gulangyu Island, please don’t have too many purposes. The best thing about the island is to wander around at will, look at the old houses, eat real local snacks, and stroll along the quiet lanes. Everything is simple and natural. Requires excessive language and embellishment. Come to Xiamen University, the most prestigious university. The campus has classical architecture, beautiful campus environment and quiet lanes. The school is very close to the beach, and the white sandy beach next to it is beautiful. In addition to the natural scenery, the third floor of the campus Furong Restaurant is extremely delicious. The campus is surrounded by mountains and the sea, with Nanputuo Temple and Huli Mountain Fort nearby. The scenery is beautiful.

Although the swimming pool on the third floor is not large and open-air, it is especially suitable for children. I like it, the water is very clean, there are many foreigners staying in this hotel, and the service is quite good. Opposite the hotel is Chaofu City, a 20-year-old brand that Xiamen locals love very much. I was still queuing up when I went there at around 2 o'clock in the afternoon. The Cantonese-style tea shop is absolutely authentic, but Dianping can line up in advance. Gulangyu Island has a strong commercial atmosphere and is really uninteresting. There are also many people, so you can buy ferry tickets in advance. The most fun thing is going out on a sailboat in Wuyuan Bay. Book on Taobao for 40 people per person, which takes about an hour. Please take sun protection measures in advance. When taking your children to play, you can also go to Yefengzhai Beach, take a speedboat, and bargain privately. For 2 adults and 2 children, it was 200 yuan, which took about 40 minutes. Guanyin Mountain also has water recreation projects for children. After going to the Railway Cultural Park, you will see the Xiamen Botanical Garden as you walk out, and you can also take a cableway to Nanputuo. You have to line up to enter Xiamen University at 12 o'clock. The scalper we found paid 40 yuan to enter. The scenery is not bad. The tunnel is quite unique. The external restaurant may be contracted. It is really terrible! Go to the Hulishan Fort early, there will be a performance by the Qing soldiers at October. Because the weather was too hot, I didn’t ride a bike on the Ring Island Road. I sat in the car and took a look around. The scenery was indeed very good. We walked around a lot on Zhongshan Road, and all of them were selling things. Finally, we chose 1980 Meat Rice Dumpling Restaurant, which offers Xiamen special snacks. People and roads are full of snacks, the prices are cheap, there are oysters for 1 yuan each, but the taste is average, foodies can go shopping. The whole journey was basically done by Didi, which was very fast. Xiamen is not a big city and the fare for four days was about 300 yuan. Wuyuanwan and Yefengzhai are relatively far away, and the fare is more than 40 yuan, while other places are basically more than ten yuan. Finally, thank you for the same trip arrangement.

Before going there, we were worried about the poor pick-up and drop-off reported online, but after rectifications, it still met our expectations. Although it had been raining for the past few days, the beautiful natural scenery still did not diminish our enthusiasm. From Gulangyu Island to Xiamen University, from Nanputuo to Zengcuo'an, the beautiful scenery everywhere deeply attracted us, and we walked around under umbrellas. There is a special feeling in the wet streets. Gulangyu Island was originally a clean island with simple people. The slow life and freshness it presented attracted Chinese and foreign tourists. Sunlight Rock, Shuzhuang Garden, Haoyue Garden, Gulangyu Piano Museum, Zheng Chenggong Memorial Hall, etc. integrate history, humanities and natural landscapes. Strolling along the alleys in every corner, you will hear the pleasant sound of piano, melodious violin, brisk guitar, moving and beautiful singing, and the rhythm of the waves from time to time.

It was so beautiful to eat seafood while admiring the sea view. The next day I went to Gulangyu Island. There were so many people. The beach was not as comfortable as Baicheng Beach. The beach was so dirty that my son was worried. I refuse to go into the water. If I go there once, I will definitely not go to the beach here. I will go to the first floor of the Wedding Dress City on Huandao Road. There are few people here and it is clean. On the third day, I will go cycling around the island, Baicheng Beach, Xiamen University (a must-do here) Reminder, Xiamen University refuses tourists to enter during the summer semester from 8.23 ​​to 9.15) We paid for someone to drive in. Furong Tunnel is still worth going, but visitors to Furong Restaurant can only go to the third floor, which is not particularly good.

It is very convenient to take Didi Express when we go out. The driver will also recommend places to play and eat. He is very enthusiastic! On the last day, I had to check out, so I rested in the hotel in the morning. After checking out, I went to Zhongshan Road. However, the weather was not good and it rained heavily. I walked around and quickly returned to the hotel. I stayed in the hotel for more than three hours. The service is very good, I will introduce it separately later! After talking about the itinerary, let’s talk about the flight. It was late coming back and forth. I was really drunk. It didn’t matter that I was half an hour late when I went. I was an hour and a half late when I came back. Alas, the service for the same journey was still in place. I sent text messages and phone calls in advance to remind you. ; Including the private car transfer we ordered, we will inform the driver’s number in advance, and the car is already waiting when we leave the airport, which is very convenient; Finally, let’s talk about the hotel. The Wyndham stay was so comfortable on the first day, the service was good, and the hotel was still there at night. There are late-night snacks. After staying at Wyndham, I feel a little uncomfortable staying at Pan Pacific. After all, everything in Wyndham is new, but Pan Pacific is also good. The clothes drying rack is very considerate and the tea bar downstairs is also very humane. Well, knowing that we were checking out and waiting for the flight, it was good not to rush us. Anyway, I haven’t had enough fun yet. I will go to Xiamen again when I have the opportunity. This time I will go explore the area first, and next time I will go for an in-depth tour!",Postive
2138,2138,"Overall, this trip was quite satisfactory. There were a few twists and turns when we checked into the Sheraton Hotel on the first day. We had to wait for almost 40 minutes, but Tongcheng helped us solve it later and we were quite satisfied. I went to SM City Plaza in the evening and it was very close to the hotel. It only took ten minutes to walk there. The next morning I went to Gulangyu Island. The scenery on the island was not bad, the hygiene was a bit poor, and the architecture was quite distinctive. In the evening, we went to Zhongshan Road Snack Street to enjoy local food. On the third day, we went to the Botanical Garden, Xiamen University, and Nanputuo Temple. The most fun ones are probably the ones on the beach around the island. My son had a great time playing there. On the last day, we took our children to the Xiamen Science and Technology Museum. A ticket was 60 yuan, and children over 1.2 meters tall had to pay the full price. However, although it is more expensive, it is still worth playing.",Postive
2139,2139,"It was a great trip. The flight was delayed by one hour, but the same trip was great. I got a text message to remind me! Highly recommend the Pan Pacific Hotel, it is great, the service attitude is super good, and the rooms are also very good! For a free breakfast buffet, I think it’s pretty good! Children under 1.2 years old have free breakfast! My kids had a lot of fun in the hotel’s outdoor swimming pool! The location of the hotel is also good! Route 87 in front of the hotel can directly go to Nanputuo, Xiamen University, Baicheng Beach, etc.! However, it is not recommended to go to Baicheng Beach, it is too dirty! It’s only two stops away from the pier! Taking a taxi from the hotel to Zhongshan Road only costs about 10 yuan. However, there are many Uber taxis in Xiamen. Zhongshan Road has a similar feel to Gulangyu Island. If you are bringing a baby, it is not recommended to walk on Gulangyu Island for too long. In case the baby feels uncomfortable during the journey, it will not work. This time on Gulangyu Island My daughter felt uncomfortable when getting in bed. She vomited all over and had no energy. When she found the tour bus and wanted to pay and go back to the pier, she refused because she said she didn’t buy an attraction package! We could only hold the baby and walk, it was so tiring! Moreover, the things on Gulangyu Island are similar to those on Zhongshan Road! But things in Xiamen are really cheap! Went to Little Eyes for dinner every day! Cheap and delicious! Next time I go to Xiamen, I will go find some local restaurants to eat! In short, except for Gulangyu Island, everything else is good! I will probably go again and book a trip on the same trip!",Postive
2140,2140,"1. Transportation itinerary: The flight is in the morning and the flight back is in the evening. You should reverse your flight times so you don’t have to carry your suitcase around after checking out. The destination is not big, so I took a taxi on Didi throughout the journey. It is an immigrant city and there are no express trains. <br>2. Accommodation and meals: The accommodation was changed from Pan Pacific to Bonhams Pullman. The star rating remains unchanged. The surrounding environment of the latter is better, but it is farther away from the scenic spot and takes a bus. The room is average, there is a locked door in the room, I don't know what it is. But the breakfast buffet is very good. There was a problem with the children's breakfast during the Chinese New Year, but the customer service quickly solved it. Thumbs up! Except for one of the meals I had near Xiamen University during the trip that was really bad, (in the picture below at the Quanzhou Beef Restaurant, the food only covered the bottom of the plate, and the taste was inedible. It was inconvenient to take pictures inside, so I could only take a picture outside as a reminder. Attention everyone) Others are acceptable. <br>3. Same journey service: five-star satisfaction! A quick solution during the Chinese New Year!",Postive
2141,2141,"Transportation: The outbound flight was delayed for nearly two hours. It was only after checking in that I realized that my child’s ID number was wrong. I was anxious to find customer service. Fortunately, I didn’t delay boarding. It is recommended that we use partner airlines for the same journey. To be improved. Accommodation: Pan Pacific Hotel is quite satisfactory. I wanted to change to a deluxe room, but it was almost full. The breakfast was rich in variety. The free swimming pool water was very clean. You must wear a swimming cap when swimming (if you don’t bring it, the hotel provides it for free). You can’t enter without changing into a swimsuit. Come on up. Hot water for bathing and electric drying are very convenient. The free gym is somewhat lacking. You can't use the equipment without wearing sports shoes. Who doesn't wear sandals in summer. Itinerary: The first stop was Xiamen University. I got up early and rushed there, but unfortunately I couldn’t get in! Due to the recent registration of new students, we will not be able to visit until mid-September. What a pity! Just take a photo at the door. It’s also good to go to the botanical garden. It’s very convenient to take a tour bus with your children on a hot day without being too tired. The tropical rainforest and psoma plants are the highlights and are worth seeing. Tsang Cuo An has a wide variety of snacks, and the oysters, lobsters, and tea noodles are delicious. That beach is too dirty, with smelly and turbid water floating around. There are many people playing in the sea. There is only one small stall on the beach where you can change clothes. It costs 10 yuan to take a shower and 2 yuan to wash your feet. If you want to use the swimming ring, it is not rented. When I bought it, I couldn’t feel the literary and artistic atmosphere at all, the commercial atmosphere was too strong. It felt good to ride around the island to Yefengzhai. The sea was relatively clean, and there was an endless stream of people taking wedding photos. The air was fresh. I experienced the beach go-kart in person and it felt very cool. There are rental lockers, changing rooms, swimming rings, etc. After a day of playing, I came to the food street on Zhongshan Road. There are all kinds of snacks and delicacies, including oysters, lobsters, crabs, and oyster omelette. They are so delicious that I can’t stop eating them... Ferry tickets for Gulangyu Island must be purchased online in advance. The residents on the island are very simple. We recommend the Maming fish noodles, Shenjia rice rolls and Uncle Lei Feng’s pancakes in the commercial street. You have to wait in a long line to get them, and Zhang Sanfeng milk tea is all in one go. Had two drinks. Passion fruit is too sour, lotus mist green mango and other tropical fruits are delicious and cheap. After the tide went out, I caught a small crab in a rock crack on the beach and tried my best to bring it home. I also brought a large bottle of sea water with me. In short, the city of Xiamen is very suitable for living. I came here 4 years ago and I will never forget the warm and hospitable people here. I am still deeply impressed when I come here again. Special thanks to the driver of the No. 84 bus for his enthusiastic guidance. He was so enthusiastic that he was afraid of you. I didn’t know how to walk when I got off the bus. By the way, Xiamen has built a subway now. I’m looking forward to my next trip.",Postive

2143,2143,"The location of the hotel is good, not too far from every scenic spot. The public transportation in Xiamen is very convenient and only costs one yuan, and even 50 cents! Xiamen’s taxis refuse to take you for short distances, so we recommend that you travel by public transportation or online car-hailing! The hotel's breakfast is also very rich, with both Chinese and Western styles! There is also a free swimming pool, which your baby loves to play in. Remember to bring your own swimming cap! We didn’t bring a swimming cap so we could only buy one for 30 yuan! For seafood, it’s recommended to go to Zengcuo’an for cheap, oysters cost ten yuan! Xiamen University Furong Restaurant is really unpalatable, just buy some snacks, don’t treat it as a meal! What I was not very satisfied with during this trip was that I placed the order nearly half a month in advance. I had always told me to get a double room, but when I arrived at the hotel, I was told that there were no double rooms! After calling Tongcheng to communicate, the customer service asked me to wait and they would resolve it as soon as possible! As a result, after I waited for three hours and made many phone calls, they told me that they still couldn't arrange a double room for me! In the end, I paid the difference of 170 yuan a day and the hotel changed me to a deluxe king bed room! Although the money was eventually refunded to me on the same trip, it still couldn’t make up for the emotional impact on my first day in Xiamen!",Postive
2144,2144,"Tongcheng text messages always provide reminders, which is very good. <br>After getting off the plane on the first day, the pick-up staff took you directly to the dock.

It is a pity that Gulangyu Island has been applying for World Heritage status in the past few days. Many places have been blocked and many distinctive buildings have not been seen. In the afternoon, take a boat to Xiamen and check into the Sheraton directly. On the third day, visit Xiamen University and Nanputuo. <br>On the fourth day, there are a lot of food at Zhongshan Road and Taiwan Food Street. You can taste it slowly here. <br>On the fifth day, we ended our 5-day happy and fulfilling trip to Xiamen and set off home. <br>The overall itinerary was quite satisfactory, and the pick-up and drop-off times were within an acceptable range.

2145,2145,"This time I chose a free trip to stay at the Sheraton for five days and four nights. The flight back and forth was not delayed. I deliberately chose a morning flight when I went there and returned in the evening, so five days was particularly sufficient. Sheraton's service is good. My kids like the food there, but they don't mind eating there. We, two adults and two children, ate over 800 yuan in one meal. Eating seafood in Xiamen is really delicious. We ate seafood on three days of our five-day trip, and the big lobster was only 198. If we ordered something else, it was a great meal for about 500 yuan. We travel by taxi every day. Whether we go to Xiamen University or Gulangyu Island, a trip on Zhongshan Road costs about 40 yuan, so one trip is almost 100 yuan. Anyway, taking a taxi every day for these five days will cost close to 200 yuan. If you are willing to squeeze in the bus, don’t worry. If you have a long time, you can choose the bus, because we are traveling in the summer, and we are most afraid of waiting for the bus, after all, we have two children. Tickets for various attractions in Xiamen are still super cheap. I feel like all our money was spent on food, drinks and taxis. On the last day, we chose Zhongshan Road to buy specialties. As for Zhang Sanfeng milk tea, we really didn’t want to drink it again after having it once. Ba Po Po is good. There are too many specialties, such as pineapple cakes ranging from 5 yuan per box to 68 yuan per box. Of course, we chose the latter because we wanted to give them to relatives and friends. We bought more than 1,000 yuan of various snacks, but they were really delicious. Remember, cheap ones are not good. Last but not least, you must wear sunscreen in the summer. My son’s skin peeled off after swimming in the sea. In short, pay attention to sun protection, eat well, don't be cheap, just enjoy it when you go out to play.",Postive
2146,2146,"Quite satisfied with the slow trip. Travel...<br>There are too many people during the summer vacation. Because the children are still in kindergarten, I specially chose this time period, but I ignored the time of the G20 Summit. Some areas in Zhejiang are on holiday, especially Hangzhou. So when I was shopping on Gulangyu Island, people saw me with my baby and said, ""You are from Hangzhou, right?"" Only the primary and secondary schools in Hangzhou have not started school -_-||<br>The topic has gone astray. As for the flight, there is almost no delay in the flight time to and from. It’s time to give us a thumbs up for our good character👍🏻<br> As for the hotel🏨, Pan Pacific is known as a five-star hotel. Its standard is the same as the four-star hotel in Shanghai. The service staff is very good, kind and courteous. Other good things can be said, the room is not big; the air conditioner is super cold, no matter how you try to heat it up or down, it is a constant temperature. Unless it is turned off, the ensuing problem is that the room is not ventilated π_π, and you are afraid to open the windows. The sliding windows do not have any protection measures. We are on the 16th floor😱. However, the transportation is very convenient. There is No. 87 downstairs, which can reach Xiamen University, Nanputuo, Huandao Road and Xiagu Pier in one car. The fare is very cheap, one yuan, only one yuan💰! <br>As for the major attractions, the second day from Xiagu Pier to Neicuoao Pier is not a regular tour group route. The advantage is that there are few people, it is clean and the scenery is goodᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ. Children can’t move their legs when they see the sand. . So I didn’t see Zhang Sanfeng Milk Tea, Ms. Zhao’s shop, or the bustling Longtou Road at all. I was just digging sand at the beach. Please remember that you can only return to Xiamen Main Island from Sanqiutou Pier after 6pm🕕. <br>On the third day of Huandao Road, we continued digging sand at Baicheng Beach. During this period, we went to Zengcuo'an for lunch. Why are they selling food and B&Bs? It is worth mentioning that riding a bicycle on the Huandao Road will destroy my old arms and legs. Important things to say three times: you can rent electric cars at B&Bs along the way, you can rent electric cars at B&Bs, you can rent electric cars at B&Bs! ! ! <br>On the fourth day, I slept until three o'clock in the morning, and it was already ten o'clock after breakfast.

It was so heavy that I had to stay in the hotel all afternoon. Definitely don’t go to Gulangyu Island to eat seafood. The number of customers is almost as high as that of Hainan. Zhongshan Road has a lot of good snacks, which are comparable to Shanghai’s Nanjing Road. The small-eye food stalls are still good, but the portions are small. Other food stalls are not good for us. It’s too simple for the elderly and children! There was a little accident on our return trip. We originally agreed to meet at 3:30 to take us to the 5 o'clock flight, but the driver didn't arrive until 4 o'clock.

2148,2148,"Self-guided tour of Xiamen - Xiamen in my eyes<br> I have read a lot of domestic travel guides, and the places I most want to visit are Xi'an, Xiamen, Jiuzhaigou, and Tibet. This trip is for me and my sister to travel independently with their two children, so I chose Visit Xiamen, a city said to be very bourgeois and romantic. <br> I checked the price of free travel in Xiamen on many travel websites. Considering the accommodation conditions and convenience of travel, I chose the five-day free travel in Xiamen with the same journey. I would like to thank Li Na, the travel consultant from Tongcheng. This little girl helped us choose a suitable itinerary for us before ordering. After ordering, she helped us with all our questions, requests, and airport transfers. This time it was very worry-free. To elaborate on this trip, we stayed at Pan Pacific for three nights. The hotel environment was very good and the service attitude was good. Breakfast was included. The breakfast was of high quality. Basically, I had a good meal in the morning and I was not hungry throughout the day. Let’s talk about it. We read a lot of guides and travel notes on the Internet. The ones on the Internet said that Xiamen locals would go to Small Eyes Seafood and 141 Seafood. We also went there. To be honest, we didn’t see many locals. They were all backpackers. In the last two days, we saw the Chao Fucheng Restaurant opposite the hotel. We ate there basically at noon and at night. They didn’t rip off customers. Many locals ate there. It turned out that the place closest to us was the authentic one. A local gourmet base, roasted squab is a must-order every time, and everything else is a must-try. It costs about 200 yuan for four people. <br> On the middle day, we went to Gulangyu Island, which has beautiful scenery and strong commercialization. We went to Longtou Road in the evening. The taste of Zhang Sanfeng milk tea was not special. Ye's mochi was delicious and there were many people queuing up. Which one do you want to eat? It takes 20 minutes to queue up. There are so many people that I no longer have the interest to taste it. The small shops are very bourgeois in decoration, and they all sell souvenirs. I bought the osmanthus honey for a friend at Su Xiaotang's shop. The clerk is very enthusiastic to let you taste it. It is fresh and sweet. The price is not low, and fortunately, shipping is free for orders over 300. We didn’t have dinner on Longtou Road because there were too many people. The hotel we stayed at was the Gulang Villa Hotel. The environment should be pretty good on Gulangyu Island. The breakfast was average. You must go to Neicuoao Pier and it takes 5 minutes to get to the hotel. <br> Also, you must download the Amap and get takeout. Some Xiamen people say very coldly that everyone has different qualities. <br>This trip was overall very enjoyable and satisfying!",Postive

Although the room was not big, it was generally clean and tidy. After putting away our luggage, we walked to Bailuzhou Park and then went to nearby Bainaohui for dinner. After dinner The bus back to the hotel is very cheap and convenient. After returning to the hotel, we went to swim in the open-air swimming pool on the third floor. The children had a lot of fun. After breakfast at the hotel the next day, we took the bus to Baicheng Beach. After the tour, we took the bus to Xiamen University. We had Chinese food at Furong Restaurant. The price was moderate, but there were too many people. After lunch, we took a rest in Furong Tunnel. In the evening, we ate seafood at the Little Glasses Food Stall. It tasted good and the price was affordable. Then we took a walk to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street.

Across the road from the hotel entrance is the seaside. The children had a lot of fun! The next day, I woke up naturally, had breakfast and wandered around Gulangyu Island leisurely. You can take the return cruise ship at Neichuo'ao Pier before 17:40 in the afternoon. The pier is about 1 kilometer away from the Sheraton bus. There is no choice. I couldn't get a taxi during the shift time. Check-in at the hotel was quick. After dinner, the children played in the bathtub and were put to sleep. After that, they went to swim on the 7th floor. The bathroom was great, with wet and dry facilities. The steam room has hot and cold pools, but the pool is slightly small. On the third day, we went straight to Xiamen University and Nanputuo Temple. The campus of Xiamen University is beautiful. It is very convenient to take the bus from Furong Tunnel to Nanputuo Temple. There is no entrance fee to Nanputuo Temple. Each visitor can receive a free incense stick. A stick of fragrant incense brings spirituality to the sincerity. Like it! Unfortunately, it started to rain after we left the temple. Those who didn’t bring an umbrella had to go back to the hotel and take their children to swim in the swimming pool. It was still a bit cold! There are residential areas near the hotel, so it’s a good idea to buy food and take it back to the hotel to enjoy! After enjoying the buffet breakfast on the fourth day, we drove straight to the road around the island. The children's favorite thing is the beach, and they never tire of digging in the sand. Walking from Huandao Road to Zengcuo'an, it's really a shopping and eating rhythm! The alleys of B&Bs have a unique flavor, but the shouts and shouts all over the streets are a bit too noisy. However, seafood is cheap and it’s up to people to be thrifty. Because my mother doesn’t like seafood, I can only enjoy it alone, which is inevitably a bit regretful~~ The bus came out from Zengcuo’an.

We turned left and right around the island, which was considered an in-depth tour first. . . The hotel is okay. We are on an island after all. The breakfast is enough and the service attitude is good. I checked out in the morning and went to play. I went to Sunlight Rock and the Piano Museum. I also tried Ba Po Po’s Burnt Fairy Grass. I really liked the pace of life on Gulangyu Island. I walked around and saw the scenery everywhere. In the afternoon, I took a boat back to Xiamen and went directly to the Pan Pacific, a high-end hotel. After checking in, I went in and took a bath. After the bath, the baby fell asleep comfortably. After sleeping for two hours, I went to the opposite hotel for dinner. I went to Chaofu City to eat. It’s just across the overpass. I checked online before and found that Chaoshan cuisine is really delicious. I recommend friends staying at the hotel to try it. . The hotel's buffet breakfast is mainly Western food, probably because there are more foreigners staying in the hotel. There is also porridge, which tastes good.

There are text messages to remind you whether you are leaving or coming back. 1. The flight was delayed when we went there. China Eastern Airlines took the initiative to change our booking to an earlier flight, which surprised us. Otherwise, we would not have known when we would be able to arrive in Xiamen. It’s just that the driver who picked us up from the airport was really bad at arranging the route. We had to stay on the island for the first night. The weather was bad and we were in a hurry. He dropped off everyone who lived in the city first and then dropped us off last. It was so wasteful. Time, very dissatisfied. It was very foggy that day, and the daytime flights were suspended. We had to wait for the night flight, and flights could be suspended at any time. If the queue was scheduled before ten o'clock, we wouldn't be able to get to the island at all. I could only buy scalper tickets, which cost dozens of dollars more. Tongcheng agreed to reimburse me as soon as possible. Special thanks to the employee number 12011 for solving my problem as soon as possible. 2. The accommodation environment is okay. On the first night on the island, it is like spring all year round. The room is big. It feels really good to wake up to the chirping of birds in the morning. The breakfast is also very rich. For the last two nights at Pan Pacific, to be honest, the room was a bit disappointing. The lights were too dark and the space was average. It was not particularly comfortable to stay. Although the breakfast was rich, it tasted really unappetizing. 3. January to May is the foggy season in Xiamen, so you must change the season next time you go. It rained the past few days, so we didn't have much fun. Gulangyu Island is still very suitable for hiking, and the air is particularly good. Xiamen University is like a garden, with beautiful environment, interesting Furong Tunnel and various graffiti. Furong Restaurant is just average, full of people and no appetite.

It was just past 11 noon when we arrived, so there wasn't anyone there yet. We ordered on the first floor and took seats on the second floor. The ordering guy was very enthusiastic. Fish are charged by the item, and other seafood is basically charged by the portion. , the prices are clearly marked, so you don’t have to worry about being ripped off, so you can order with confidence, hahaha. <br>[Stir-fried crab crab] 108 per pound, you can also choose the steaming method. The little brother said that stir-frying is more delicious, but too much thickening hides the unique texture of the crab meat itself, but there is really a lot of paste , still very enjoyable. Maybe I'll try steaming it next time. <br>[Salt and Pepper Shrimp and Mushrooms] Hangzhou calls shrimp and mushroom pp shrimp. It can only be said that whether it is Zhejiang or Fujian, the salt and pepper method is really a perfect match for shrimp and mushroom ~ the salt and pepper pp shrimp are salty and delicious, and the saltiness of salt and pepper is just right to maximize Maximize the flavor of shrimps and mushrooms. Although peeling shrimp mushrooms is more troublesome, it still doesn’t stop me from loving them, hehe~<br>[Jinchang Fish with Scallion Oil] 68/piece. I don’t know if the Jinchang fish in Xiamen and the pomfret bream in Hangzhou are the same species, but the Jinchang fish is really big and fat, and it is really different from the small pomfret bream in Hangzhou. The cooking method of scallion oil is very suitable for my personal taste. It is very delicious and the fish meat of Jinchang fish is also very tender and delicious. Although it is thick, it does not make people feel old at all. Recommended~<br>[Stir-fried clams] Xiamen’s stir-fries seem to prefer thickening the gravy, and thickening the gravy a lot. The clams themselves are very fresh, and each one is very big, which is not common in Hangzhou. I ate several clams during my trip to Xiamen, and I still can’t get enough of them. It would be more in line with my taste if the gravy could be thickened less~<br>[Pumpkin Leaves] As the only vegetable we ordered, the portion was surprisingly large. Moreover, the pumpkin leaves are relatively tender, have a strong garlic aroma, and taste good~ I don’t often eat pumpkin leaves in Hangzhou, but when I came to Xiamen, I found that almost every restaurant has pumpkin leaves, which is amazing~<br><br>There are many seafood restaurants in Xiamen After comprehensively comparing several food stalls, I feel that the price/performance ratio of Zuiyihao Seafood Food Stall is higher than that of Xin Aqiang and the like in Small Glasses. Personally, I think the overall feeling is pretty good. Friends traveling to Xiamen may wish to give it a try. After all, If you come to Xiamen to eat seafood, it is indeed very fresh and the prices are basically very affordable.",Postive

I have to give myself a big thumbs up! <br>I have to say that Tongcheng's service is quite good, and the hotel environment I stayed in is also pretty good. However, the size and structure of the two rooms are different, which makes me speechless. <br>One more thing to praise the driver who picked us up at the airport. He was very nice and carefully explained Xiamen's tourist attractions to us along the way. On the contrary, the airport drop-off man was a bit speechless. We originally made an appointment the day before to pick us up at the hotel door at 10 a.m. the next morning, but he called us at around 7 a.m. to urge us to leave, and ordered that we should be given a maximum of twenty minutes. When we came down, everyone came out in a hurry without even having breakfast. <br>Gulangyu Island is really a place worth visiting if there are few people.

The children also liked the swimming pool at night. Our three-night stay allowed us to get enough rest, which was great. The following is our itinerary: arrived at the hotel on day 1, went to Zhongshan Road in the evening, and tasted snacks; went to Gulangyu Island on day 2. The weather is quite sunny now, but we stopped and walked, visited some scenic spots, and tasted snacks. It was quite complete and special. Standing on the top of Sunlight Rock, I was still a little excited. I went to Xiamen University on day 3. There is no chance for the beautiful and romantic Xiamen University. I hope my daughter can be a junior sister here in the future. There is also Ding'ao Zai Cat Street, which is more Japanese-style and is very suitable for little girls to take pictures. In the evening, I went to Zeng Cuo'an, a snack street. Day 4 was relatively leisurely. I went to Shapowei, a small and fresh place for literature and art that I wanted to go to.

The children in the villa hotel’s swimming pool love swimming at night and it’s not too cold. They can play until half past nine. The hotel The beach is right outside, which is very convenient for traveling. 3. The villa hotel has a battery car that can be picked up and dropped off at the pier, but it requires an appointment at the front desk. 4. The villa hotel has group meals that are more affordable than the stalls outside. 5. The Pullman hotel has a bathtub for taking a bubble bath, which is very comfortable. 6. Pullman's buffet breakfast is delicious and has many varieties. There are also self-service group purchases at noon and evening. It is cheaper to buy on Dianping.com and has more varieties than the self-service buffets of other hotels. Disadvantages: 1. The bedding in the villa hotel is a bit trendy. The bed in the room near the swimming pool is very large. It is made up of two single beds but there is a gap in the middle. It is uncomfortable to sleep on. 2. Most of the taxi drivers in Xiamen city are not locals and deceive consumers secretly. Use the meter to pick us up and lie about the detour. The service attitude is poor. I suggest you don’t take a taxi. Didi Express is very good. 3. The swimming pool of the Pullman Hotel is too cold and the temperature is not as cold as the open-air swimming pool of the villa hotel. 4. The response of Pullman’s room service The time is too long. It usually takes about 20 minutes for a shower gel to be delivered. 5. There are basically no TVs in the villa hotel and there are too few programs to watch<br> Strategy: 1. The Neicuoao Pier is close to the villa hotel. Walk about 1 kilometer along the seaside to get there. 2. Refrigerator magnets on Gulangyu Island are twice as expensive as Zengcuo’an. 3.

It is best to order in advance through **, and the timetable is also displayed on **. 5.

2163,2163,"The pleasant vacation is over, time flies so fast. This trip to Xiamen was quite pleasant, but of course it was not perfect. The flight was delayed on the first day, and it was almost six o'clock when we settled into the hotel. The Pan Pacific was pretty good, but the subway was built in front of the door, which was very confusing. I wanted to go to the Zhongshan Road Food Street, but since it was a Friday night, there was no way to get there. There was no one to take the order from Didi Taxi. The guard told me to take the No. 31 bus. I forgot to ask which stop. I asked several people on the bus and the result was different. What’s even more disgusting is that this bus didn’t even announce the stop name. The screen turned off at the end, so that we were dragged to the terminal, so we had to find a seafood stall nearby. In the end, we were ripped off for two dishes and ate more than 700 yuan. I was really helpless, but luckily we started starting the next day. It went well. The beach in Baicheng is very dirty, but the one in Yefengzhai is good. Biking around the island is very tiring, and you have to pay attention to sun protection. The scenery along the way from Baicheng to Yefengzhai is beautiful, and many people take wedding photos. Gulangyu Island was very leisurely and I didn’t visit all the scenic spots because I was very tired walking on the island. I only saw Sunlight Rock.

However, there are many ** networks, and competition is fierce now. I hope the prices of same-trip services can be adjusted. The Xiamen hotel we arranged to stay in was very high-end, and the buffet breakfast was also good. One person should be 168! I forgot to bring my swimsuit. There is a swimming pool on the third floor of the hotel. The sea in Xiamen is quite dirty at 10 pm. It is not recommended to go into the sea. There is a bus 50 meters away, or you can wait for the waiter to call you a taxi in front of the hotel. What are the attractions to visit in Xiamen? It's relatively centralized, and a taxi only costs about 20 yuan. After visiting Xiamen University, you can rent a small electric car for a reasonable price, ride the Huandao Road and then go to Zengcuo'an for snacks. Three hours is enough without going to the bar. I rented a car for four hours for only 100 yuan. Xiamen is sweltering now, and it’s super uncomfortable. It’s more comfortable to take an effortless electric motorcycle. The hotel we went to Gulangyu Island was the Four Seasons Hotel. It was a genuine hotel. It was very different from the Pan Pacific. Moreover, all the attractions were near Sanqiutian Pier. The coupons on the island are valid for five attractions in one day. To be honest, it was too rushed. I must remind everyone that there is a wet market on Longtou Road, which is very lively. There are vendors at the door. I recommend that you buy seafood and process it yourself. The processing fee is said to be five yuan. In fact, it is not at all. They all take rebates from both ends to buy seafood. It doesn’t matter whether it’s enough or not, but the processing place tells you that prices vary depending on how you prepare it. Three dishes and one soup cost 64 yuan, and my husband said that there wasn’t enough lobster meat to count, so the shrimp heads were replaced with ** shrimps, and they were given disposable plastic ones. They also charge 2 yuan for each bowl, which is really bullying tourists! Everyone must remember that ""Wang Jiujiu"" is too dark to go, can't go, can't go, and say important things three times! ! !

Behind the hotel is Huwei Mountain, and across the road is Chaofu Hotpot City. The transportation is also very convenient. The deepest impression on me of Xiamen is that the whole city is very clean. It deserves to be called a hygienic city. I visited several places: Nanputuo Temple, Xiamen University, Gulangyu Island, and Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. The one I felt the most about was Xiamen University, which is known as the most beautiful campus in the country. It’s not an exaggeration. In addition to being a good place to study, it is also a good place to fall in love. However, Gulangyu is far from what was expected. The commercial atmosphere is too strong and houses are being built everywhere. Is it over-developed? There are ""wild guides"" everywhere, which feels very bad. Overall, it's a worthwhile trip!",Postive
2179,2179,"The trip to Xiamen was generally good. Tongcheng had many shortcomings. On the travel page, it was required to be picked up and dropped off at the hotel. However, we stayed at Gulangyu Island the night we arrived in Xiamen. Tongcheng took a group of 5 of us to Xiamen by bus. The ferry terminal was only open to foreign tourists at 18:50, so we bought tickets and waited at the terminal for more than an hour. We should have been sent to Dongdu Cruise Terminal, and then from Neicuo'ao Pier to Gulangyu Island. We made a half circle around Gulangyu Island at Sanqiutian Pier at 8pm. For hotels that cannot send guests to Gulangyu Island, I hope Tongcheng will not write hotel pick-up and drop-off services on the page. It is suspected of deception. Nowadays, many travel apps have hotel addresses with navigation links. Tongcheng has not yet hoped that Tongcheng can improve it. The hotel arrangement is okay. , praise it!",Postive

The next day I went to Gulangyu Island. The sky was very blue, and you could have a panoramic view from the top of Sunlight Rock. There were also various buildings, which were worth a visit. We also went to the most beautiful campus, Xiamen University, where we relived our student days and were filled with emotion.

The points are still very good. The Hilton is a bit remote and far from the attractions. Fortunately, it is very convenient to take a taxi. I didn't drink the jelly that was given because I was in a hurry. The cookies provided by the hotel were indeed delicious, and the breakfast buffet was also very good.

Many small shops are not hygienic. We ate seafood instead of eating at the hotel where we stayed. The children liked the hotel swimming pool very much, but they were too tired from playing every day, so they swam once. What I’m talking about in particular is when you go out to buy specialties, don’t buy the cheap stuff. When you go out to bring some specialties to give to your friends, you should still choose the ones that taste more authentic. There were no delays in the return flight.

There is a bus stop at the door, which can be used directly for No. 31. To get to the ferry, take the underground passage to near Zhongshan Road, but on the return trip, get off opposite the hotel. Due to the construction of the subway, you need to cross the bridge to get to the opposite side. It is recommended not to go directly to Huandao Road.

It is difficult to buy tickets in the morning on the spot. There are a lot of people in Zhongshan Street, but there is actually not much to see. It is similar to Wangfujing Pedestrian Street in Beijing. The snacks are sold to outsiders, are expensive and taste average. Xiamen University recommends going on weekends.

You can go to Yefeng Village to watch the sunrise and Gulangyu Island to watch the sea and scenery. Each scenic spot is a good place to take pictures. The wax museum on Gulangyu Island is good. I personally think this trip is quite good. Yes, the only thing I am not satisfied with is the environment of Gulangyu Hotel. It looks very beautiful from the outside, but the room is very simple inside and there are a lot of mosquitoes...",Postive
2212,2212,"The trip to Xiamen ended successfully, except that the flights to and from were delayed. I originally wanted to take the more convenient way from Wuxi, but the result was disastrous! I feel that Xiamen is relatively clean among all tourist cities. The accommodation is very good and the food is very expensive. It is not expensive in general. Seafood should be cheap because it is close to the sea. I didn't expect it to be very expensive. You can't eat it on Gulangyu Island! The beach kids had a lot of fun. Everything about the souvenirs was very exquisite and the packaging was classy. I just didn’t know how it tasted. I bought it after seeing the packaging anyway. It’s so beautiful! The weather was also good, except for the last day which was a bit hot. Everything else was very good. Overall, free travel in Xiamen is the best choice!",Postive
2213,2213,"The transportation in Xiamen is really convenient. The bus fare is only 1 yuan everywhere! If you have children, someone will give you a seat, which is a nice custom. It is especially suitable for taking babies to play. It is surrounded by green and the environment is really great. There are green shades everywhere. The hotel service is also very good. They will bow to you when you meet. It is so uncomfortable and can help you solve many problems. The bathroom is so spacious, with shower and bathtub options; it is truly worthy of a 5-star hotel. The swimming pool is also great, but I forgot to bring a swimming ring. It is recommended that those with children must bring a swimming ring. The hotel does not sell it, nor can I find it outside! The breakfast was just average. After eating it for three days in a row, it didn’t change, so I got a little tired of it. The hotel is conveniently located from various scenic spots, especially from Xiagu Pier, which is just over a kilometer walk away. A very nice self-driving tour.",Postive

Pajamas, umbrellas, and a small refrigerator are provided for guests in the room! The breakfast is also good, and it is from 6:30 am to 10:30 am. The hotel is only 15 yuan by Didi Express from Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, and 9 yuan by Didi Express from Gulangyu Xiagu Pier. The location is pretty good! When going to Gulangyu Island, you can pay attention to Xiamen Ferry and buy tickets in advance. There are many unscrupulous businesses on Gulangyu Island, and there are also many wild tour guides. If you hire a tour guide, be sure not to follow them to drink tea or eat!",Postive
2215,2215,"I was very happy about my trip to Xiamen. The plane was delayed for half an hour when I arrived. On the first day I arrived in Xiamen, I went straight to eat some glasses. Then I went sailing in Wuyuan Bay. On the second day, I rented a car and drove to Yunshuiyao to see the earth buildings. We went to Xiamen University and Baicheng Beach on three days, visited the beautiful Gulangyu Island on the fourth day, and went shopping on Zhongshan Road to buy souvenirs on the fifth day. It went well and the weather was generally good. The hotel facilities are a bit old, but the hotel service is good. The WiFi signal in the room was not very good. The hotel provided me with a separate wireless router, which was great. The location of the hotel is good and the transportation is very convenient. However, Xiamen is not too hot in the summer, but the ultraviolet rays are strong. Pay attention to sun protection and bring an umbrella with you when traveling.

I like Gulangyu Island and Xiamen University. However, many shops in Gulangyu Snack Street are being decorated in a mess. Not to mention Xiamen University, it is very beautiful and artistic. I went to the nearby Nanputuo Temple, Baicheng Beach and Huandao Road. I envy the children who go to school there. I would like to remind everyone to pay attention to the time. Monday to Friday noon is around 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock, and you can only enter after 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Schedule your time. I also went to Zengcuo'an, which is full of snack bars, and Zhongshan Road, which is suitable for shopping. The botanical garden is also good, but it closes at six o'clock. You can climb the mountain and see the beautiful Xiamen below.",Postive

Staying at the Pan Pacific Hotel was very comfortable, and the breakfast was rich in both Chinese and Western styles. The bus at the door is more convenient, but taking a taxi is not very convenient. Short-distance taxis are not allowed, and Didi taxis are not convenient. There are few taxis and it is difficult to hail one. Bailian's airport pick-up service was a bit poor. We had to wait for forty minutes to pick up the airport. The guy who took us to the airport was also quite impatient. Generally speaking, self-guided tours can be arranged by yourself, which is relatively easy. Xiamen is too hot in sauna mode, and restaurants in many places such as snack streets and Zhongshan Road may not have air conditioning. It is very sunny outside and street trees do not provide shade. Be sure to wear sunscreen. , everyone came back with a tan. There are too many people in Gulangyu Island, and it is heavily commercialized. There is a small black insect the size of sesame seeds that bites people very badly. It is recommended to wear long pants and bring mosquito water.",Postive

You can directly swipe your ID card to enter at any time. After coming out of Xiamen University, we went to Baicheng Beach. There were so many people on the beach and the children had so much fun that they didn’t want to go back. Gulangyu Island is at the ferry terminal on the second day. It is recommended to book your tickets online in advance, otherwise you may not be able to buy tickets on site. Gulangyu Island is suitable for strolling and playing slowly. There are no cars on the island, so you have to walk. Children may feel tired and need to stop and go.",Postive
2220,2220,"The trip to Xiamen was generally good. Tongcheng had many shortcomings. On the travel page, it was required to be picked up and dropped off at the hotel. However, we stayed at Gulangyu Island the night we arrived in Xiamen. Tongcheng took a group of 5 of us to Xiamen by bus. The ferry terminal was only open to foreign tourists at 18:50, so we bought tickets and waited at the terminal for more than an hour. We should have been sent to Dongdu Cruise Terminal, and then from Neicuo'ao Pier to Gulangyu Island. We made a half circle around Gulangyu Island at Sanqiutian Pier at 8pm. For hotels that cannot send guests to Gulangyu Island, I hope Tongcheng will not write hotel pick-up and drop-off services on the page. It is suspected of deception. Nowadays, many travel apps have hotel addresses with navigation links. Tongcheng has not yet hoped that Tongcheng can improve it. The hotel arrangement is okay. , praise it!",Postive

If you take a taxi, you can get there in a few minutes. Of course, you can also take bus. Bus No. 87 can reach all attractions. It is very convenient and only costs one yuan to get there. It is recommended that you book your ferry tickets online before going to Gulangyu Island to prevent you from buying tickets very late or even unable to buy them. The day after we arrived, we went to Putuo Temple, Xiamen University, and Baicheng Beach. These attractions are all together and can be visited together. Went to Gulangyu Island on the third day.

The transportation is convenient and seamless. As soon as you get off the plane, there will be a driver to pick you up and a driver to drop you off when you leave. 2. Xiamen is not big. It is very convenient to take buses from the Pan Pacific Hotel where you stay to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, Botanical Garden, Xiamen University, and Nanputuo Temple. 3. Recommended snacks in Xiamen include peanut soup, sand tea noodles, fish ball soup, and bamboo shoot jelly. If you are convenient, you can get these at the Huangzehe Time-honored Restaurant on Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. 4. Let’s talk about the hotel. The staff are friendly and the breakfast is quite rich. Even if you stayed for three days and made some minor adjustments, it can still meet the needs of breakfast. I personally think it is good. Some people say that the breakfast is not good. They can only say that they are too picky. . 5. This is not my first time in Xiamen.

2225,2225,"I still had a lot of fun this trip! The flight was delayed for an hour when we came back, but it was no big deal! We went to Gulangyu Island first. The hotel on Gulangyu Island is very close to Neicuoao Pier. You can see it after leaving the pier, but it is a bit far from Longtou Road and various scenic spots. We got lost when we came back on the first night. The walking navigation on Amap seems to be not very accurate! Because I’m allergic to seafood, I didn’t try any seafood. It gave me the feeling that Gulangyu Island is too commercialized! The two of us ordered a serving of ginger duck, a plate of scrambled eggs with tomatoes and two servings of rice for 103! ! I won’t leave a review! But the scenery is really beautiful. Many wedding photos are taken, and the scenery is really beautiful every time you take a photo! Don’t have high hopes for the underwater world on Gulangyu Island! It’s really a bit small! Finally, I have nothing to say about Tongcheng’s service. I am as satisfied as ever! I was very satisfied with the free trip to Beijing I booked with Tongcheng before, and this time I was not disappointed with the free trip to Xiamen either!",Postive
2226,2226,"The return flight was delayed for three and a half hours, taxiing and shuttle took over half an hour, and we waited for nearly an hour to check in our luggage. Let’s talk about the Gulangyu Hotel. The room is a bit small, but fortunately there is an outside balcony, and behind it is the hotel swimming pool. It is a bit noisy at night, but it gets quiet after 10:30. If you want to go to the swimming pool, you need to bring your own swimsuit, swimming cap and lifebuoy. A swimming cap costs 18 yuan, and a lifebuoy rental costs 10 yuan. Breakfast is pretty good, free for those under 1.2 meters tall. There are two piers in Gulangyu Island. This one is close to Zengcuo'ao Pier and takes about 8 minutes by foot. If you arrive after 3:15 in the afternoon, you can call the hotel and use a battery car to pick you up. The day before, I strolled on the beach at Gulangshi in front of the hotel. There were many people taking wedding photos. The next day I visited Shuzhuang Garden and the food street on Longtou Road, and watched the Ocean Park for an hour. The price was 90 for adults and 50 for children (charges apply for those over one meter). It is incomparable to Changfeng Ocean Park. The sea lion performance venue is better. Simple. I walked nearly 15,000 steps to these attractions in one day. (I saw Panji Hotel right next to the pier. I was so close and envious.) By the way, let’s play an episode. On the first day, there was a pick-up man who took us to the pier. On the second day, he called me and informed me that we would be arriving at 6 o’clock. I went to the airport and went back. I was speechless. I contacted Tongcheng’s customer service and they didn’t say anything. On the third day, I returned to Xiamen city and checked into the Sheraton Hotel. I was told that it was only for one night. I quickly contacted Tongcheng's customer service. Later, they were told that the system was delayed and the system would display after 8 pm. I had to go to the front desk to re-swipe my card after 8 pm and it would take a day. Let’s talk about this Sheraton. It’s a relatively old five-star hotel. The facilities are okay. The bed is relatively wide, so it’s not too cramped to sleep with children. There’s also a chaise sofa for easy protection, but there are no children’s toiletries. This needs to be improved. Breakfast is not based on height, half price is 69 yuan for 4-14 years old, which is not cost-effective for small children. In the afternoon, I went to the third-ranked Botanical Garden and bought a 10-yuan bus ticket for three attractions. The tropical rainforest is classic, but the succulents are boring. The last attraction was a rip-off. After getting off the bus and walking for a long time, I saw a broken airplane. We can no longer trick people with broken tanks. It is recommended to see a tropical rain forest, go straight to the top of the mountain and take another road down the mountain to see the garden architecture attractions. On the fourth day, I slept until noon and took a taxi to Xiamen University. I wanted to go to Baicheng Beach, but saw a long queue at the door at 11 o'clock, so we had to queue together. (Xiamen University allows 500 people to visit after 12 noon from Monday to Friday, and there is no limit on weekends). Then I went to Nanputuo next door, climbed a mountain, ate at an expensive and not delicious vegetarian restaurant, and went to Zengcuo'an for snacks in the evening. Street (I just ate a bunch of ice, and I didn’t want to eat the rest), and I didn’t see any artistic fishing villages. On the fifth day, I got up at noon and went to the SM Plaza near the hotel. Wanda Cinema was very expensive. The cheapest movie ticket was 96 yuan. I quickly took a taxi and went to the nearby Panji Famous Center to watch a movie. A ticket was 34 yuan. People under 1.2 meters tall were not allowed. The price for a family of three plus taxi fare is 78, which is a good deal. I ordered a 118 set meal at the nearby Xishan Farmhouse in the evening. It was a great deal. After dinner, I rushed to the airport and ended the trip. It is recommended that Tongcheng take independent travel orders seriously and do not repeatedly make mistakes in pick-up and drop-off times and hotel reservations. Fortunately, it was solved later. There was no need for drop-off at the airport. It was too early and I took a taxi to the airport.",Postive

In the end, I chose Wuyuan because I love cleanliness. Hilton Hotel in Bay<br>Transportation: I booked a pick-up and drop-off on the same journey from home. The driver who left at 4:30 in the morning was very serious and responsible and arrived as soon as possible. It was raining that morning.

When I came back, the hotel's drop-off was also very good. I contacted them in advance. The flight was delayed and the time was changed again. I was not unhappy. The flight back was a bit annoying. It was already 3 o'clock when I got home in Beijing<br>Hotel: I have to say This time the Hilton Hotel was really nice. I had an executive room for two days and a bay view room for three days. It was really beautiful. The scenery was so beautiful. Compared to me who grew up in a place without the sea, I felt so happy to be able to see the sea every day. Everything in the room was very well arranged. All items were clean. The towels did not smell of inferior detergent. The capsule coffee machine in the executive room was also very interesting. We had an executive room for 2 days during our independent trip. It was the first time to stay in an executive room and experience the executive lounge. You can go to the 22nd floor for afternoon tea starting from 17:30 every day. There are many kinds of tea. You can feel full and taste good. The hotel breakfast is also very good and has many kinds. I think there are quite a lot of kinds. I may not have seen other five-star breakfasts. The hotel's wifi will also be available for membership soon. Regarding transportation after arrival, although the hotel is far from the city, there is a shuttle bus to Xiagu Pier at 9:50 every day. It can be booked in advance. It is very convenient. The hotel's gym and swimming pool are also very good. The gym facilities I have in Beijing are even better and worth visiting. There are also massage and hot spring baths that are very suitable for children to swim in.<br>In short, I am very satisfied with the hotel and transportation this time.

2228,2228,"Overall, I was satisfied with this trip. The hotel stay was comfortable, the flight time was good, and we stayed for 5 full days. The slow pace of life in Xiamen was very pleasant. <br>Disadvantages:<br>1. The van used for airport pick-up and drop-off service was quite dirty. I originally thought it was the hotel's commercial vehicle, but it was a bit different from what I imagined. <br>2. The hotel we stayed in was on the 7th floor. The floor was a bit low. When I took a shower at night, I found that hot water could not come out. It felt like the room had not been occupied for a while. After calling the main station, the master repaired it the next day. <br>3. We met a driver who took us to a scenic spot in Dolphin Bay. The price of the sailboat there was 198 per person, which was more than 100 more than the market price. Fortunately, we refrained from going. Later, the local driver recommended a sailing tour next to the hotel. <br>To summarize: The trip to Xiamen was mainly to take the children out for a winter vacation. The children dug sand at the beach, shopped and ate, and had fun all the way. This trip was very satisfying. Thanks to Tongcheng Consultants for their coordination and arrangements. From the itinerary to the flight arrival and airport changes, there is tracking and coordination. The service is very professional. I will consider Tongcheng again for future travels.",Postive
2229,2229,"This time I booked a three-day free trip with two flights to Xiamen, and I will definitely give it a big thumbs up! I made a plan a week before my trip and booked a ticket for the Xiagu Pier Ferry in advance. The ticket is for a round trip to Gulangyu Island and is valid for a round trip within 20 days. This can be purchased by adding a public account with **. You must purchase it four days in advance, otherwise the flight you want may not be available. The plane arrived in Xiamen on time at nine o'clock in the morning on the day of travel. Because the pick-up staff contacted us one day in advance, they picked us up smoothly and took us to the Pacific Hotel. The hotel is not as bad as some people commented. We stayed in a standard room with a window on the side of the road. It was quite clean. The breakfast varieties were relatively small, but the taste was quite good. What is worthy of praise is that the hotel's location is really great. There is a bus stop to the left of the gate. The whole journey is 1 yuan. Bus No. 135 covers almost most of Xiamen's famous attractions. It is also very close to Xiagu Pier and is within walking distance. It is quite convenient to go to Gulangyu Island in ten minutes. It is also officially because of the convenient transportation. Some people commented that the hotel is a bit noisy by the roadside. I personally think it's completely acceptable, just think about it yourself. To give you some reference, Xiamen University and Nanputuo Temple are close to each other, and next to Hulishan Fort is Baicheng Beach. Friends who are foodies can go to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street and Zengcuo'an. The snacks there are dazzling and will definitely satisfy your taste buds. If you are traveling with children on Gulangyu Island, the day is a bit tight. It is best to stay on the island for one night, because this is an island without motor vehicles. In addition to walking, you can also take the battery car on the island. The package ticket for the attraction is 100 yuan whether you book it online or buy it at the attraction. The weather in Xiamen is cool in the morning and evening and very hot at noon, so you don’t need to wear too many clothes.

When I arrived in Xiamen, the pick-up driver did not contact me. However, the specialist made a call as soon as I turned on my phone after landing. Full marks for this. He told me how to get to the pick-up point. I waited at the pick-up point for about 15 minutes (Travel I asked Tongcheng’s customer service before if they accept orders individually, and the customer service told me yes.) The driver came, and since there were people in the back, I could only sit in the front, and I didn’t want to say anything about the car’s condition. We arrived at the Kempinski Hotel in about 20 minutes. Overall, it was okay. The attitude at the front desk was not complimentary, so I paid a 2,000 deposit. When I got to the room, it didn't feel big, rather small. After I asked the service center to bring me a match, they told me that this floor was a non-smoking floor. I'm really speechless. Didn't I ask beforehand? I changed to the 11th floor and this room is much bigger. Overall, the hotel is good. I was hungry after getting off the plane. The hotel has an ordering service. The food is delivered 24 hours a day. The order is usually delivered within half an hour. You can try the wine shop in the hotel. There were foreigners singing on the day I went. The buffet dinner on the second floor is also good. There are quite a lot of varieties and the service is good. The breakfast is also OK. According to my standards, it is pretty good. You should eat light or light, and you should eat oily or oily. It is difficult to call a taxi at the hotel. It is very fast to call through the mobile phone app. The doorman is always running around and does not always stand there. There they will open the door for you and get your luggage. The customer service attitude of Tongcheng is also very good. They will follow up and ask me if I have any problems. This is really good. The pick-up service paid me 25 yuan for the price difference.... Gulangyu Island in Xiamen is good, as well as Zhongshan Pedestrian Street and Zengcuo. There is a very long snack street and many bars in An’na. It really makes you doubt your life. It is enough to visit these places in Xiamen, as well as Xiamen University.

I made a plan a week before the trip and booked a ticket for the Xiagu Pier Ferry in advance. The ticket is for a round trip to Gulangyu Island and is valid for a round trip within 20 days. This can be purchased by adding a public account with **. You must purchase it four days in advance, otherwise the flight you want may not be available. The plane arrived in Xiamen on time at nine o'clock in the morning on the day of travel. Because the pick-up staff contacted us one day in advance, they picked us up smoothly and took us to the Pacific Hotel. The hotel is not as bad as some people commented. We stayed in a standard room with a window on the side of the road. It was quite clean. The breakfast varieties were relatively small, but the taste was quite good. What is worthy of praise is that the hotel's location is really great. There is a bus stop to the left of the gate. The whole journey is 1 yuan. Bus No. 135 covers almost most of Xiamen's famous attractions. It is also very close to Xiagu Pier and is within walking distance. It is quite convenient to go to Gulangyu Island in ten minutes. It is also officially because of the convenient transportation. Some people commented that the hotel is a bit noisy by the roadside. I personally think it's completely acceptable, just think about it yourself. To give you some reference, Xiamen University and Nanputuo Temple are close to each other, and next to Hulishan Fort is Baicheng Beach. Friends who are foodies can go to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street and Zengcuo'an. The snacks there are dazzling and will definitely satisfy your taste buds. If you are traveling with children on Gulangyu Island, the day is a bit tight. It is best to stay on the island for one night, because this is an island without motor vehicles. In addition to walking, you can also take the battery car on the island. The package ticket for the attraction is 100 yuan whether you book it online or buy it at the attraction. The weather in Xiamen is cool in the morning and evening and very hot at noon, so you don’t need to wear too many clothes. On the last day, the driver called the hotel in advance to pick us up and took us to the airport safely. I am really satisfied with the whole trip. It is a very cost-effective independent trip. I will choose you again if necessary in the future!",Postive
2236,2236,"The second time we traveled on the same trip, the flight was on time, and we spent 3 full days in Xiamen. The overall feeling is that Xiamen is not as high-end as imagined. Maybe I had too high expectations before. The hotel is in a good location and it is very convenient to take the bus. Route 87 is basically universal. There are too many people in the queue at Xiamen University. You can only enter at 12 o'clock every day. The limit is 300 people. If you queue after 11 o'clock, it will be too late. Nan Putuo said it is. Must-see attractions. Personally, I feel that if you don’t believe in Buddhism, it’s not interesting to go there. Even climbing a mountain and the scenery is not very good. The botanical garden is worth visiting. The plants are well maintained and can be enjoyed for most of the day. It is also recommended to take a sightseeing bus and go sailing on the Huandao Road. It is very exciting and you can sail into the high seas and see Taiwan on the opposite side. When you come back, you can ride a bicycle along the Huandao Road. Things on Zhongshan Road are too expensive, so I recommend going to Zengcuo’an. Food and tourist souvenirs are much cheaper. It’s best to bring sunscreen when traveling. My husband and I came back from riding on Huandao Road and our faces turned red. Generally speaking, there are very few restaurants in Xiamen. It’s a good place to have a proper meal. It was almost impossible to find one along the road. We ordered ** takeout for dinner for two days, but we were really helpless. It is said that there is no need to buy tickets for the five major scenic spots in Gulangyu Island. It is very beautiful just to take pictures. It is recommended to spend more than half a day. It is a pity that Yunshuiyao and Tulou were not visited. If you have the feeling of an ancient town, Nanputuo and Xiamen University are not recommended.",Postive

Moreover, Xiamen is relatively small, so it’s very convenient to get to the airport in about 20 minutes. This time I stayed at Pan Pacific, and I felt that the service was very good as soon as I entered. The front desk and doormen felt very professional, and there were many foreign tourists. I didn't know much about this hotel before, but I might consider it after this experience is better. The hotel room is quite small and fully functional. There are many mirrors in the bathroom. The space is large and bright. It is very comfortable to put on makeup and take a bath. This is the highlight of this hotel. However, I feel that the hotel windows cannot open by themselves, so sometimes it feels a little stuffy. . There is a community behind the hotel, so it is very convenient to buy things downstairs. The pharmacy and fruit shop are very close. The hotel is only a 5-minute drive from the cruise center. It is very close. If you go to Gulangyu Island, you need to buy tickets for the Xiagu Pier of the cruise center. Diagonally across the road from the hotel is an international community with many foreign hotels and seafood hotels. It is very convenient to wash your hair and eat. The buffet dinner in the hotel itself is not very recommended. You can go to the seafood buffet with more than 300 yuan next to the hotel, which is very good value. The last picture is of the hotel’s buffet breakfast which is not bad. The hotel's room service opens very late, so you don't have to worry about running out of food if you check in late. It will be faster to check out by swiping your credit card for pre-authorization deposit.",Postive

When I went there, the plane was delayed for three hours and I was very depressed. I should have arrived at ten o’clock, but the flight didn’t arrive until eleven o’clock. When I arrived at the hotel, it was two o’clock. We went to sleep directly. The next day we had breakfast and the kids slept until 10:30. We took the kids to Zhongshan Street to eat some noodles, and then went to Xiamen University. I want to say here that there are scalpers who charge ten yuan each to bring them. When you go in, you actually come out of the underground passage and jump in the queue, but this exit is close to the gate. After that, we planned to go to Zengcuo'an, but the taxi driver said that no one was there at the BRICS meeting and recommended that we go see the sailing dolphin ride. , and ended up going to 178. Children under 1.2 meters tall were charged half the price alone. Let’s go and have fun when you’re all here. Generally speaking, it’s okay, but no one thought that this was all a routine. Let’s focus on this, Xiamen If the driver refuses to take you, he will take you to the place where you want to spend money. Don’t trust it. Zengcuo’an has a lot of food, so you can enjoy it. Gulangyu is a literary and fresh place. There is a beach where I took the children to play in the sand for two hours. I slept until I woke up naturally on the last day. , it’s over.

Almost all of them have sea mushrooms. Anyway, I didn’t taste them. I just bought tickets for the five major tourist attractions in the sea. It’s 100 each. There is no need to go to other websites to play in half a day. There are pearl jewelry sellers all over Xiamen. There was an aunt who picked a basket and sold beautiful earrings😭😭I regretted not buying it. I went out of Zengcuo'an, Nanputuo, Xiamen University, Gulangyu Island. They are all good.

The swimming pool is heated, a little cold, but the water is very clean. You can hear music playing in the water when diving. This is too good. Bravo. We had a buffet at the hotel for New Year's Eve dinner, which was very average and not recommended. The hotel is very close to two snack streets. It only takes 15 minutes to walk there. There are many people in the snack street and there is a lot to eat. The food in Xiamen is quite good. One thing is particularly good. The prices are clearly marked and everyone likes them. Don’t worry, you can sell it with confidence, and you can eat with confidence. The seafood is very good. A meal for six people basically ranges from 500 to 1,000, which is still very affordable. I originally thought that the breakfast room rate I booked was a bit expensive, and I was a little confused. But after asking, I found out that the prices for our three rooms during the Spring Festival were all 2,700, and I felt happy instantly. This trip to Xiamen was quite good.

If you contact us early, at least you won’t have to worry about playing. <br>Fortunately, I paid extra money to change my round-trip air tickets, so I didn’t have to go to the hotel late at night or early in the morning. I arrived at noon, and I could visit one more attraction in the afternoon. I happened to snap up the 19.9 Science and Technology Museum ticket on the app one day in advance and took my children to play. I no longer have to wait in the hotel for the whole afternoon to be cleaned and to get a room.

The bed in the room is on the small side. Generally, a single bed in a five-star hotel is at least 1.4 meters wide. In this hotel, the width is at most 1.2 meters. It is a bit cramped to sleep with children. The toiletries in the room are too low, especially the conditioner, which is almost the same as water. I really regret not bringing it myself. I was too trusting in the quality of five-star hotels. <br>The Four Seasons Spring Hotel on Gulangyu Island is good.

On the first day, I went to Guanyin Mountain and took a sailboat to go out to sea. It was very interesting. Then I went to the Ice and Snow Kingdom. It was really cold inside. These two attractions gave me the feeling of ice and fire! Then we went to Nanputuo after lunch. It was not as grand as our Jiuhua Mountain, but it was very delicate and delicate!

Thank you! <br>When I arrived at Xiamen Airport, I contacted the airport for pick-up. After waiting for a few minutes, a minibus arrived. Not bad. Take a look at the city of Xiamen along the way. It is clean, beautiful and comfortable. When we arrived at Pan Pacific, the store was small, quite clean, and the service attitude was very good. There are security registrations for entering and exiting the guest rooms. It is necessary for individuals to feel safe. There are not many varieties of breakfast in the hotel, mainly Western style, and the quality is okay. The guest room is not big, the design is warm and clean. The bathroom is quite big. The whole facility is ok. There are some restaurants diagonally opposite the hotel, and there is a bus stop near the door. It only costs one yuan to get there. Two stops away from the cruise center. When we arrived at Xiamen University, someone in our group didn’t bring his ID card, so he didn’t go in. I went to Nanputuo Temple nearby and bought a few boxes of vegetarian cakes. I went to Zengcuo'an in the evening and called a special car. The road was very congested and it took almost an hour to drive. When I came down, there were people on both sides, which felt very bad. There are just some snacks inside, and I really don’t feel the petty bourgeois literature and art (the ancient towns and streets across the country basically have the same taste, which is too much).

Fortunately, it had air conditioning, but the air conditioning was not very powerful! The hotel is not far from the airport. The subway is being built at the door and I suddenly felt that the hotel's aura was not enough. There was also the BRIC Conference in Xiamen, so it took a while to check in. After settling in, I took the little one to swim, then went to Bensley Seafood Restaurant to eat seafood and stroll around Zhongshan Road. The next day, I woke up naturally and had breakfast at the hotel. The buffet breakfast was okay and had many varieties. Then I went to Nanputuo Temple. The temple is not big and there is no admission fee. There is a big white orchid tree inside which is very fragrant. . Then I went to Xiamen University. I went at 12 o'clock. When I saw the long queue, I was immediately confused. I spent 50 yuan to be placed in front of the queue. Now that I think about it, I am really scared. It is easy to get into trouble because of the crowd. I guess I went half an hour late. There aren’t that many people. After entering the campus, I had to walk but didn’t go anywhere. I strolled around the Furong Tunnel. I had a drink in the university restaurant and sat for a while. Then I walked out of the Baicheng gate and went to the beach. The beach is very beautiful. Children like to play in the sea. There are many places along the beach. You can walk to Huli Mountain Fort. The weather was too hot, so I fled back to the hotel and took a shower. In the evening, my local friends in Xiamen treated me to seafood at the Peony Restaurant in Aoyong Square. The old restaurant is really good and worth a visit! On the third day, we went to the Botanical Garden. The botanical garden is very big. We chartered a sightseeing car, which really saved a lot of effort. The driver would wait for us at every attraction. The botanical garden has a tropical rainforest, a cactus pavilion, a succulent plant pavilion, a viewing platform, and flowers. Park, national defense education base. After leaving the botanical garden, we went back to the hotel to pick up our luggage and headed straight to Gulangyu Island. Gulangyu Villa Hotel is not far from Neicuoao Pier. Maybe it’s because of the beach. The room smelled a bit musty. There is a beach in front of the hotel. It was already 7pm after resting in the hotel. It's half past midnight, and it's already very quiet outside when I go out to look for food. There are people sitting on the beach in twos and threes enjoying the shade. There was no place to eat, so we had to go back to the restaurant in front of the hotel. Seafood was relatively expensive. We weighed two crabs for 500 yuan and a large squid for 300 yuan. Other shrimps and other items were ordered by the portion. It was already very late after finishing the meal. I went back to the hotel to sleep. I felt that staying on the island was not interesting. Maybe the hotel was located a bit off. On the last day, we went to Gulangyu Island to play in the sea, eat snacks, and visit Shell Dream World, Shuzhuang Garden, and Piano Museum. Then we took a sightseeing bus to Neicuoao Pier. The scenery along the way was beautiful and we saw many old-fashioned buildings. The driver who took the return ferry to Xiagu Pier was already waiting there. The 8 o'clock flight took us to the airport before 6 o'clock. The biggest failure of this trip was that the plane was delayed again and didn't take off until the early morning.

Across the street, there is a tea restaurant that locals often go to. The food is also very delicious. Chaofulou specializes in health and does not add MSG... The road is being built recently, so taking a taxi will be a little inconvenient. It is very close to Gulangyu Pier. It’s only a few kilometers away and you can walk there. There are only three bus stops. The hotel offers free fitness and swimming. The swimming pool is very clean. It’s very convenient to take a taxi to various attractions. The longest distance is only 32 yuan... The service on the same journey is also very good. The return flight is delayed. Will call us immediately...all in all a great experience.",Postive

It’s very convenient to call a taxi and the people in Xiamen are very welcoming. <br>Pan Pacific Hotel, the service is very satisfactory, the room is also good, but there are too many mirrors in the room. <br>Zhongshan Road: The most visited place these days is Zhongshan Road. Many shops in the pedestrian street are undergoing major renovations. A little further back on Zhongshan Road, Chinatown and Tiger City are still quite lively. There are a lot of places to eat. Recommended restaurants: Tangyan Private Kitchen. <br>Rhehe Lu: Renhe Lu is a night stall, not my type. <br>Baicheng Beach: I felt so high when I saw the beach, but Mickey Mouse hit me hard on the beach. I enthusiastically came over to take a photo with you... After taking the photo, I took out a piece of paper and asked for 20 yuan. <br>On the third day, Gulangyu Island<br>It is very convenient to go back and forth. The two hotels are very close. The Pannuo Hotel is very warm when you enter the hospital. They are all themed rooms with good styles, but the big bed room (round bed) is really The room was too small, so I paid an extra 260 yuan for a courtyard room. The hotel is a bit far away from the central garden. You can take a sightseeing bus to the pier for 30 yuan. <br>Finally, I want to talk about the airport pick-up service. I praise it very much. The service is good and you don’t have to find a car yourself. It is very convenient.",Postive

Just use Baidu Map to search for buses. This is my second time staying at this hotel. I am very satisfied with the environment. Although there are buildings around, it does not affect my mood. The breakfast is rich and varied. I have eaten there for 5 days. I never tire of it. The attitude of the waiters in the breakfast department is worthy of praise. I am very satisfied. When I went to the hotel on the first day, the front desk said that we could upgrade the room type with extra money. After reading it, the front desk clerk didn't agree and his face dropped. When he asked how to access the wireless network, he said it in a very cool tone, but he showed us the room. The duty manager has a consistent attitude, otherwise we would be embarrassed. Xiamen is worth a vacation. The weather is good, the sun is shining, it is close to the seaside, and there are many delicious snacks.

2255,2255,"This time I booked a four-day free trip to Xiamen with two flights, and I will definitely give it a big thumbs up! I made a plan a week before the trip and booked a ticket for the Xiagu Pier Ferry in advance. The ticket is for a round trip to Gulangyu Island and is valid for a round trip within 20 days. This can be purchased by adding a public account with **. You must purchase it four days in advance, otherwise the flight you want may not be available. The plane arrived in Xiamen on time at nine o'clock in the morning on the day of travel. Because the pick-up staff contacted us one day in advance, they picked us up smoothly and took us to the Pacific Hotel. The hotel is not as bad as some people commented. We stayed in a standard room with a window on the side of the road. It was quite clean. The breakfast varieties were relatively small, but the taste was quite good. What is worthy of praise is that the hotel's location is really great. There is a bus stop to the left of the gate. The whole journey is 1 yuan. Bus No. 135 covers almost most of Xiamen's famous attractions. It is also very close to Xiagu Pier and is within walking distance. It is quite convenient to go to Gulangyu Island in ten minutes. It is also officially because of the convenient transportation. Some people commented that the hotel is a bit noisy by the roadside. I personally think it's completely acceptable, just think about it yourself. To give you some reference, Xiamen University and Nanputuo Temple are close to each other, and next to Hulishan Fort is Baicheng Beach. Friends who are foodies can go to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street and Zengcuo'an. The snacks there are dazzling and will definitely satisfy your taste buds. If you are traveling with children on Gulangyu Island, the day is a bit tight. It is best to stay on the island for one night, because this is an island without motor vehicles. In addition to walking, you can also take the battery car on the island. The package ticket for the attraction is 100 yuan whether you book it online or buy it at the attraction. The weather in Xiamen is cool in the morning and evening and very hot at noon, so you don’t need to wear too many clothes. On the last day, the driver called the hotel in advance to pick us up and took us to the airport safely. I am really satisfied with the whole trip. It is a very cost-effective independent trip.

2256,2256,"The trip to Xiamen is over, let me talk about my experience of this trip, and it can also be a reference for friends who will travel to Xiamen next time:<br>1: Xiamen’s famous hotels are very unique and cheap. It is recommended to stay in Zengcuo’an before going out. It’s the snack street, and the beach is across the road;<br>2: As a seaside city, seafood is its soul, the price is cheap, and the taste is authentic. You can eat it in Zengcuo’an, and the oysters are basically one piece;<br>3: Traveling is basic The bus costs 1 yuan per person and can reach all basic scenic spots. DiDi is more convenient. You can use Mobike for night tours. It is very comfortable to face the sea breeze;<br>4: If you have children, you can play more at the beach. The sea water chases you, and children’s ideals are sand and water. It is recommended to go to Yefeng Village, One Country, Two Systems, Music Square, Pearl Bay, Huangcuo Bathing Beach and other beaches. The water quality is clean and the sand is relatively clean;<br>5: If If you are a couple, you can go to Gulangyu Island to stay. It is a very romantic place, but it is not recommended to go with children. There is no transportation on the island and everything is done on foot; <br>6: It is recommended to travel freely, the hotel is very good, wear sun protection and be sensible. Consumption. Compared with Xiamen, Hainan, the consumption is lower, so there is no need to worry about being cheated. In short, I have a high opinion of the locals. 😝[cover face]",Postive
2257,2257,"This trip I chose to travel by air + wine. It was a very good experience. There was a pick-up and drop-off service. As soon as I got off the plane, I received a call from the airport pick-up man. He was very considerate and sent me to the hotel quickly. When I went back I also contacted one day in advance to confirm the return time. It was very convenient. Let me talk about the hotel. The hotel facilities are average and not up to five-star level, but the service is first-rate. The hotel is in a good location, very close to Xiamen-Gu Ferry and 2 bus stops away. It’s also very close to Zhongshan Road. After leaving the hotel, I took a taxi and went directly to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. The fare was 13 yuan. I ate local specialties on Zhongshan Road. What I especially want to mention is that there is a path next to the pedestrian street called Yuehuasha Tea. There were so many people queuing up for the noodles, and the sand tea noodles were so delicious. In particular, I bought the ferry ticket to Gulangyu Island a week in advance. I originally wanted to go to Gulangyu Island the next day, but the ticket was sold out and I could only put it away. I went to Gulangyu Island on the third day, Xiamen University on the second day, biked to Huandao Road and the Fort, and in the afternoon I went to Zengcuo'an. Zengcuo'an was too commercialized, so I was a little disappointed, so I took a boat on the morning of the third day. Gulangyu Island, I went to Sunlight Rock, Shuzhuang Park, beautiful scenery, blue sky and white clouds, sunshine, beach, it is worth a visit. I had dinner on the island, watched Gulangyu Island at night, and then left by boat with a satisfied mood.

2258,2258,"Xiamen is a wonderful city. When I came back to sort out the photos, I found that every photo of Xiamen is sparkling, haha, the sunshine is soft, the city is full of literary and artistic atmosphere, the scenic spots are compact, and it is the most comfortable to travel independently. After getting off the airport, we went straight to Gulangyu Island. This is a small island without any motorized transportation. You will fall in love with it as soon as you get out of the pier. It takes about 15 minutes to walk from the pier to the hotel, Gulang Villa Hotel, and the hotel rooms have open-plan On the balcony, the boy took the initiative to help carry the luggage. In front of the door is the beach, and there is a big stone with ""Gulang Stone"" written on it. Tourists rush to take pictures here. Two days later, I checked into the Pan Pacific Hotel. This hotel is a five-star hotel. I thought that staying in a four-star hotel in Gulangyu first, and then staying in this five-star hotel would feel ""better and better"", but the actual experience was worse! Even though they knew I was bringing a child, they still assigned us a room farthest from the elevator - it was really the farthest - which was okay. The waiter didn't take us to the room, but turned several corners to find the room. It’s actually smaller than the room in Gulangyu, well, that’s okay! But when I went to bed at night, I could really hear the voices in the room next door. At first, I thought the people next door were talking too loudly, so I called the front desk of the hotel because I couldn't sleep. Soon a waiter came and knocked on the door of the next room, but less than half an hour later, the sound was very noisy again! ——It seems that the sound insulation of this room is too poor. It was still the same the second night. My satisfaction with the experience of staying in this hotel dropped instantly. I will not stay in this hotel next time. Most hotels in Xiamen are near Zengcuo'an, which is in the south of Xiamen, and this hotel is relatively far from various attractions.

Route 78 leads directly to the cruise terminal to Gulangyu Island. Round-trip ferry tickets to Gulangyu Island need to be purchased in advance on the ferry company's official public account with real names. Tourists go to Gulangyu Island from the cruise terminal, but for the return trip, they can choose to go directly to Zhongshan Road Ferry Station. Xiamen is more beautiful and cleaner than before. This time I went on a 5-day trip with my mother, and she was very satisfied. Especially the hotel facilities, environment, and breakfast were all good. But as the best hotel in Xiamen at present, the toiletries are not branded, which is a bit regretful and embarrassing.

I have to say that the service at the villa hotel is particularly good, and the handsome guy on duty at night is really nice! I had diarrhea at night, and the handsome guy gave me two bottles of Po Chai Pills, one to take at night and one for the next morning. He was so considerate!

2262,2262,"1. Airplane. Because I wanted to have more time, I added money and changed my flight. However, after going to Xiamen n+1 times, I actually forgot that Xiamen flights are famous for being late. I encountered air traffic control almost every time, and this time too No exception. When I left, I was two hours late. When I came back, I was more than five hours late. On the way to Gaoqi Airport, I received a text message reminding me that the plane was delayed for two hours. When I arrived at the airport, I wandered around for a while and it turned into... The flight was delayed by more than five hours. Although the delay of the flight had nothing to do with the same journey, it would affect my mood to some extent. <br>2. Pick up at the airport. Because the flight to Xiamen was delayed, the driver who picked me up was already arriving at Gaoqi Airport, but I was still on the plane at Tianhe Airport that had not taken off. The driver's Mandarin was a little poor, which made communication a bit difficult, and the dispatcher immediately Contact me and ask me to contact them after I arrive at Gaoqi Airport, and they will send another car to pick me up. After getting off the plane, I called the dispatcher. The driver who picked me up arrived in about ten minutes. He was neatly dressed and the car was clean. It made people feel good. Although the driver who gave the gift was not wearing work clothes, it was a good thing. It's nice to be talkative. <br>3. Accommodation. I have been to Xiamen many times. Every time I go, I book a room online many days in advance. The rooms with better environment are usually full, but the customs are ordinary and too humid. This trip is really easy to go. I suddenly decided to go out with my husband to relax, so we chose to travel independently. We didn’t have to worry about air tickets or hotels. We stayed on Gulangyu Island for the first night. When we got to the island, we searched for a while before we found the B&B we were staying in. The location was pretty good. First-timers need to rely on navigation. We checked in quickly. The boss personally took us up there and decorated it in various ways. Everything was okay, and there was no damp feeling or smell. The only drawback was that there were no windows in the whole room, which made people feel a little depressed. On the second and third days, we stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel. The hotel was not far from the pier. After getting off the ship, my husband and I went there. It happened that the hotel was upgrading the room for an event. After comparing the rooms, we paid extra to upgrade the room. . The Pan Pacific Hotel is good, and since we upgraded to the VIP floor, the overall experience will be much better. I have read before that the hotel front desk is too small, and the check-in is too slow. This does not exist for us, because the VIP floor can directly Go to the VIP floor to check in and check out, which saves a lot of time. There are also many discounts and services that can be enjoyed on the VIP floor, so I give Pan Pacific five points for accommodation. <br>4. Travel. Fortunately, the sun shone brightly throughout our four-day trip. Because I have been here many times before, my overall impression of Xiamen is not particularly good. Especially many local business people have very bad attitudes in all aspects. But this time, my husband and I felt that it was different from before. I don’t know if it’s due to the influence of the diamond. This time I went to Xiamen, there were obviously many fewer tourists than before. There were fewer tourists, and the business was definitely not as good as before, so the services of those vendors were much better than before. I originally planned to find a cafe to sit in, but it turned out that no matter whether it was Gulangyu or Zengcuo'an, there were not many bars and cafes left.",Postive

Then we had lunch in the nearby town of Lukang. The three-cup chicken tasted great. Oh, the weather is too hot. I will sleep in the afternoon and go out at night. The hotel is nice, with an outdoor swimming pool on the third floor. At 17:00, we took bus 87 across from the hotel entrance to Xiamen University (there is no limit to Xiamen University after 17:00). We also saw the tunnel. I don’t know whether it was by students or tourists. The beautiful wall paintings were full of names and scrawled names. After a trip, it was a pity that I walked out of the tunnel and took bus 135 to Dongdu Huwei Mountain, got off the bus and walked a few hundred meters to the hotel. The next day we went to Zengcuo'an and Hulishan Fort. Fortunately, my wife bought two skirts and went back to the hotel in the afternoon. My daughter swam in the hotel. The weather turned cloudy on the morning of the third day, so I decided to go to the Botanical Garden first (I chose to book a ferry ticket during my free trip, 14:50, Xiagu Pier), check out first, and store my luggage in the hotel. The Botanical Garden is very big, but the weather is getting worse. It got hotter and hotter, so I returned to the hotel at noon and had lunch at a local lunch shop next to the hotel, which was okay.

The swimming pool and gym are also very good. I especially recommend that friends who go to Xiamen must go sailing, it is very exciting. Tickets can be purchased in groups.

The hotel stayed at the Pan Pacific 5-star hotel, which included breakfast for two people on the 4th day. The hotel service was quite satisfactory.

I hadn’t exercised for a long time and was so tired that I spent half a day and had a vegetarian meal directly at Putuo Temple at noon, because I was tired and hungry after climbing the mountain, so I ate very deliciously –> In the afternoon I went to Baicheng Beach to play in the sand. It was the first time I went to the beach and the children were so excited. I chased the waves on the beach barefoot –> Next I went to Zengcuo’an to eat Seafood, Xiamen seafood is really cheap, small oysters cost one yuan each, lobster and abalone are very good.

We were lucky, and we happened to catch up with someone who refunded their tickets. Visiting Sunlight Rock, Zheng He Memorial Hall, etc. on Legulang Island is just a trip around the island. The ticket you bought can theoretically stay on the island for 20 days and return. On the fourth day, I bought a ticket to Guanyin Mountain Fantasy Water World on the same trip and spent half a day playing there. Many activities require a height of 1.4 or above to play.

The Gulangyu Villa Hotel I stayed at is right on the seaside, next to Gulang Stone, not far from Neicuo'ao. It's only a few minutes from the pier. When you go out and see the sea, it reminds you of Haizi's poem ""Facing the sea, spring flowers are blooming"". Walking on the seaside at night, blowing the sea breeze, listening to the sound of waves, a journey to relax the body, mind and soul. On the second day, I bought a package ticket for 5 attractions (booked one day in advance), went to Sunlight Rock at 6:30 in the morning, walked up and down for an hour, and then returned to the hotel for breakfast. After breakfast, we completed the check-out procedures, stored our luggage, and continued our tour of the remaining 4 scenic spots. We then took a boat back to Xiamen at around 1:00 pm. The timing was just right! I stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Xiamen, a five-star hotel. The room was a little small, but the bed was very comfortable, so I was quite satisfied. In Xiamen City, I saw Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, which is quite high-end. I also saw Nanputuo Temple, Hulishan Fort, Zengcuo'an and Huandao Road. These points are in the same direction. It costs about 30 yuan to take a taxi from the hotel. There are direct buses, or Very convenient. The shortcomings are: first, the customer service is not familiar with the hotels on the island, and the pier was far away when buying the ferry ticket.

The pick-up driver called me an hour before arriving at the station. Although there was an unexpected delay when I came back to pick up the car, it was delayed by almost 40 minutes. Still resolved satisfactorily. The hotel environment is very good. Fortunately, the receptionist reminded us that we need to book Gulangyu ferry tickets in advance, otherwise it will definitely affect the trip. That night, I took a cruise and enjoyed the night view of Xiamen, which was really beautiful. When I arrived at Xiamen University the next day, I was a little disappointed because it was the first semester and I couldn’t go in. On the third day, I originally planned to go to Gulangyu Island in the morning, but because the ferry ticket was only available after 4 p.m., I had to change my itinerary and take my children to the Science and Technology Museum during the day. The scenery of Gulangyu Island at night is very good and unique. There were so many snacks, and I was so full that my eyes were full after walking all the way. I hated that my stomach was too small. On the fourth day, I went to Gaobei Tulou King and Yunshui Yao. The very distinctive earth buildings are all built with three materials: earth, wood, and stone. They have hundreds of years of history. It’s incredible. It was a total of 5 days of travel. I was tired but happy at the same time.

Arrive in Xiamen at 10:30 in the morning on the first day, take a taxi directly to the ferry center (you bought the ferry ticket online in advance, no need to exchange the ticket, just swipe your ID card), and catch the 11:30 boat (a little late), 12 Go to Gulangyu Island, take a battery car to the hotel, check in for accommodation, and then start shopping. In fact, Gulangyu Island is not big, and the streets are very short. It is the commercial street. I bought Su Xiaotang (the store has free shipping), visited the Upside Down Museum (the photo effect is very good, my son likes it very much), the Underwater World, and walked on the beach at night. In the morning, I took my son to the beach to continue playing, and then went to Sunlight Rock and Shuzhuang Garden. I took a boat back to Xiamen at noon, rested in the hotel in the afternoon (there is a swimming pool on the 3rd floor, you can swim for free), and set off for Wuyuan Bay at 4:30 Sail on a sailboat. On the third day, I went to the World Trade Center in the morning, walked back to Zhongshan Road (not so good, they were all foreigners), rested in the afternoon, and arrived at Xiamen University at 5:30 in the evening. There was no need to find scalpers. The queue was actually very fast, and the weather was not hot, 40 minutes. Just went in. The flight returns at 12:05 on the fourth day. The general feeling is that traveling independently is more relaxed and casual, but you need to make your itinerary arrangements in advance. DiDi taxis are better than taxis. The Huangjia Hotel in Gulangyu Island has a good location, next to the seaside, but the sound insulation is very poor. The Pan Pacific Hotel has a good environment and convenient transportation. There is a bus stop right outside the door, and the service staff has a good attitude. You don’t need to worry about booking air tickets and hotels, the same trip is arranged very well!",Postive

The environment is good and the room is clean and tidy, which is good for the island. It was a bit slow to get off the boat, and we queued up to check in at the hotel. Business was booming! I was given a room without windows at the beginning. I was not satisfied with it, so the front desk immediately changed it. There were no king-bed rooms in the same price range, and I was upgraded to a courtyard room for free. The service was good. The double breakfast is nothing special. It costs more than 70 per person.

After coordination with the same journey, it was successfully resolved in about half an hour. On the first day, after checking into the hotel in the afternoon, I went shopping at Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street in the evening. Although I also queued up to buy Ba Po Po’s Shao Xiancao, I was not used to the taste and almost all three cups were wasted. After eating and drinking around, we returned to the hotel.

There were many snacks. Shrimp cakes were the most delicious ones I have eaten, as well as sand tea noodles and the like. Go to the music fountain in the evening. Note that the music fountain is only open on Saturday nights. The next morning I went to Xiamen University and Nan Putuo. You need to bring your ID card to enter Xiamen University and there is no time limit for visiting only on Saturdays and Sundays. You have to see things like the Lover's Valley Tunnel. After shopping, I went to the beach next to it and the sea view was particularly beautiful. Went to Xiti in the evening. Get up and check out on the third day and go straight to Gulangyu Island. The ticket purchased includes round trip. Gulangyu Villa Hotel took the initiative to tell the hotel to upgrade to a sea view room, and be sure to select a room. The balcony of one room was blocked by the shade of a tree and could not see the sea. It is very pleasant to sit on the balcony and enjoy the sea breeze. In the afternoon, we set off to Longtou Road. All the delicious food is here, and the Turkish ice cream, rice rolls and candies are particularly famous. The more authentic Huang Sheng Kee is the smaller one at No. 95, Longtou Road. There is also Miss Zhao’s shop. I bought a stamped copy. I went to Long Time No See Bar in the evening. I went a little early, but the song happened to be my favorite.

The morning flight arrived in Xiamen at around 8 o'clock. This time we chose Juneyao Airlines and Shandong Airlines. They were both great. After we left the airport, someone picked us up and sent us to the Hilton. They received us in a very organized manner, because there were many people there at 9 o'clock. After checking out, we had to store our luggage first and chose the sailboat not far from the hotel. We took our children to experience the feeling of a sailboat, which was great! We went back to the hotel for the buffet at noon. After resting for a while in the afternoon, we took a taxi to Zeng Cuo Nun, which was full of snacks. After a while, we went to Huandao Road, rented a car, and wandered around for a while. There were many people, and we enjoyed the sea breeze. Not bad indeed! After Huandao Road, we took a taxi and walked around Zhongshan Street, then went back to the hotel to sleep! We went to Gulangyu Island the next morning (it is best to book tickets online in advance, otherwise it will be difficult to buy tickets). We walked around Gulangyu Island and bought some specialties! I took my children to the underwater world, but I felt that the least worthwhile part was the underwater world. The sea lion show only lasted a few minutes, which was a bit disappointing! In the afternoon, the sun was not too strong, so I went to the beach for a walk. . . The short second day was over, and on the third day we slept until we woke up naturally. We went to Xiamen University. The scenery of Xiamen University is picturesque.

2278,2278,"First of all, I would like to praise Tongcheng’s service and arrangements, especially the airport pick-up and drop-off, which was very timely. The driver called me before I even got off the plane. Then, as for the hotel, I think it is well-known in Xiamen. The Pan Pacific Hotel is located near Zhongshan Road. It is a certain distance from Zengcuo'an and Huandao Road. Taking a taxi costs more than 30 yuan. Many people choose to stay in the famous hotel in Zengcuo'an. I think it's not bad. First of all, it's not expensive, and it's very chic and artistic. More importantly, it's not far from the seaside. And it's also good to live near Xiamen University. A good choice, close to the seaside, and we have a seafood restaurant in a nearby Cat Street, the price is affordable, the big crab is only 65 yuan, and the grilled oysters from next door are 30 yuan for half a dozen, 6 pieces, I feel that the taste is no better than that of Little Glasses Seafood The store is bad. Many people will choose to ride bicycles on Huandao Road. It is very comfortable. Our family of three rented an electric bicycle at Mao Street for 50 yuan a day. Although we only rode for a few hours, it felt like it was worth it in Xiamen. Yes, it is a tourist attraction after all. On the last day we went to Gulangyu Island and stayed at the Gulangyu Villa Hotel. It is very close to Neicuoao Pier and is very convenient. It is only 10 minutes away. Gulangyu Island is very big. At best, we can visit it for two days. I only played for one day, and I still feel like I still haven’t finished playing. The Gulangyu Villa Hotel is pretty good overall. It is opposite the beach and is very beautiful. Especially the Western restaurant next door to the hotel. The service and taste are not satisfactory. It costs 5 yuan to add rice.

This time, the most satisfying thing about the trip was the hotel I stayed in - the Pan Pacific Hotel. It was very nice, with a sea view tower and a swimming pool. The main location is good, very close to Zhongshan Road and the Cruise Center Terminal. It is not as noisy as Zhongshan Road and is very suitable for living. I suggest you go to Shapowei, which is a place frequented by locals. There are unique restaurants and dessert shops on both sides of the street. I really want to try every one of them. It's a pity that my eyes are big but my stomach is small. Finally, my boyfriend and I accidentally chose a rice noodle shop. It was really delicious, especially the soup. It was really delicious. I plan to try it again if I have the chance to try it again. I recommend it to everyone. . ps: It’s best not to go to Xiamen in August. It’s really hot. Your clothes will get soaked every day.

Personally, I think the most worthwhile place to go is Xiamen University. The most beautiful campus is well-deserved. Gulangyu Island is also good. The sea is right outside our hotel. It has a veritable sea view room. Walking by the sea at night. Lazyly blowing the sea breeze, drinking coconuts, and listening to the handsome little brother playing guitar and singing, the feeling of comfort is indescribable.

You have to go to Dongdu Wharf to buy a ferry ticket. There is a self-service machine and the ticket is 35 for a round trip. After you get off the boat, there is a car to the Sea Garden Hotel. It is recommended not to walk there by yourself... because I am just myself. It's quite far to walk in and it's not easy to walk around because there are so many people. It's recommended to bring a coat. We ate at No. 6 restaurant on the island and there was also a Lantau seafood restaurant. They were pretty good and the price was good. There was a shuttle bus the night before the return trip. I called to make an appointment. I think this is a really bad review because the flight is at 9pm and I am not sure about the departure time. If you make a reservation at that time, he said you can’t change it and you can only cancel it. The attitude is very bad and it really affects your mood. It happened to rain those few days and it was very cold on the island. People lined up at the pier at three or four o'clock and the queues were very long. We came the night before to confirm so that people could only give us an approximate estimate. In the end, we took a taxi to the airport because of the weather.

We were sent directly to the Pan Pacific Hotel. The hotel facilities are good and the breakfast has a lot of variety. My niece casually wrote on a piece of paper in the room that the signal was poor because of the poor network. When she came back from playing that day, she found that a router was installed in the room and she wrote down the password on the piece of paper. The service is really good! ! Let’s talk about the trip: It was already 7pm when we arrived at the hotel on the first day. I took two cars directly to Zhongshan Road. Tried the food there. There are oysters, scallops, peanut soup, etc. At around 10 o'clock, we took the bus back to the hotel and rested. After breakfast the next day, we set off to Nanputuo Temple around 8:30, and then had lunch at Xiamen University’s Furong Restaurant to experience university life, but the price was not too affordable. Exit Xiamen University through the tunnel and go to Huandao Road. Rented a bicycle and followed the Ring Road. I heard from the locals that there are sailboats. I searched it immediately and decided. Call someone to pick up the phone. It just takes a bit long. If you mind, you can call in advance. Due to the cold weather, I had to wear less clothes. I went back to the hotel to change my clothes and went to the Little Glasses Food Stall for dinner. Finally go back to the hotel to rest. Here is a reminder for everyone. The buses in Xiamen do not necessarily follow the same route back and forth, so you must pay attention carefully to avoid taking the wrong route. On the third day, we booked a 50-yuan luxury cruise to Gulangyu Island. Bought a package. I bought a ticket and went to the aquarium again. We ended up eating a lot of snacks.

But they upgraded us to a five-star hotel, the Swiss International Hotel, for free. I have to say that it was really considerate. The hotel is also very comfortable. You can see Gulangyu Island directly. The room is also very clean. There is also a swimming pool and a gym. The breakfast is also very rich and very good. Satisfied, but the only thing I'm not satisfied with is that this package does not have an airport pick-up service, so I will be a little tired and have to find a car by myself. Also, the flight time is really too early. I have to get up very early to catch the flight. If I change my flight, it will be extra. Too much money. It’s really hot when I go to Xiamen in July, and I’ll get tanned in just half a day, so I suggest that friends who go there must bring sun protection gear. Also, there are bugs the size of medium-sized sesame seeds, which are really poisonous. If you are bitten, just take a small bag. It was extremely itchy, and I was still itching uncomfortably many days after I returned home, so I had to prepare mosquito repellent when I went there, otherwise it would be really uncomfortable if I got bitten. Besides, when it comes to food, the streets are full of seafood. It's very cheap, which is really a big bonus for foodies. The hotel is also very close to Zhongshan Road. You can go shopping at night. There are many people and it's very lively. Zengcuo'an is also full of snacks and there are some small bars. Go shopping... In short, this trip is generally satisfactory, but I feel that the time is still a little short. It still takes at least a week or so to have a good time.

Xiamen is inseparable from eating and eating, so we went to Zhongshan Road on the first night. I didn’t want to run around much because I had a kid. I didn’t go looking for famous restaurants on the Internet, so I went to a shop with a lot of people. The food was pretty good. The next day I went to Gulangyu Island. The weather was too hot and there was not much to see. In one word, I was tired! It is recommended to buy a battery ticket when going to the island, so that you can still take the bus even if you are tired from shopping. If you don't buy a ticket, you can't buy a ticket on the island even if you have money. Fortunately, there are strollers for rent on the island, which is 50 yuan a day, which solved a big trouble for me. Don't go barefoot on the beach, it's very hot. After a while, two blisters appeared on your feet😭 After returning from Gulangyu Island, I went to Zeng Cuo'an in the evening.

The driver said that Hulishan was not worth seeing and suggested that we go sailing. It seemed to make sense, so just go. Unexpectedly, we were taken to a tourist store and boasted to us that it was a regular store. The driver was very enthusiastic and took the initiative to get out of the car and take us into the store. At this time, we knew that we were being solicited. When I asked about the fare, it was 198 per person for a one-hour sailboat. Children were not even half-priced. I was really disappointed! I would like to thank Tongcheng customer service Lei Lei. ** asked about the Wuyuanwan Sailing Base, so I decisively called the express train to Wuyuan Bay. In the end, we, 2 adults and 2 children, spent 260 yuan to take the sailboat, which was not bad. In short, this trip to Xiamen was generally good.

It is also a place where I have a lot of fun. Gulangyu is a must-see. Secondly, there are Zengcuo'an, Nanputuo, Guanyin Mountain, and the Sailing Visitor Center, which are all very interesting. For a few dozen dollars, one person can go out to sea for more than an hour on a sailboat. To the high seas next to the small Kinmen where Taiwan is stationed, eight people in a boat can put their feet into the sea and wash their feet. If you are lucky, you may encounter dolphins.

In fact, there was no need to worry. . . Xiamen is a small city and has very developed public transportation. The whole journey is only one yuan but takes about an hour. It is suitable to take your time and see the city without being in a hurry. . And taking a taxi to relatively distant scenic spots such as Gulangyu Pier costs about 60 yuan. You can book the hotel's free bus in advance, but it is very difficult to buy tickets for Gulangyu Island. Many people can only book it on the official website more than a week in advance, and they may not be able to book it. Of course, there is a very fun sailing club near the hotel you have booked. Be sure to play. It is very close. It is only a five to ten minute walk away. You can also book in advance and have the club pick you up.

The information Tongcheng sent me also said it was a double room. When I arrived at the hotel, I found that it was a standard room and it was difficult to change.

The swimming pool on the 7th floor of the hotel is very clean. My daughter goes swimming every day. The breakfast buffet is rich in variety, both Chinese and Western. However, one room only includes two breakfasts, so my daughter That one was paid for at one's own expense, and it cost more than 70 at half price. Breakfast for three days cost more than 200, which was really expensive! The hotel is only a ten-minute drive from the airport, but far from the scenic spots, and it takes half an hour to drive without traffic jams. <br>In comparison, the hotel conditions on Gulangyu Island are very average. They are equivalent to express hotels. The location is relatively remote and it takes more than 15 minutes to walk from the scenic spots. However, the sea is in front of the hotel, so it is convenient for children to play in the sand. <br>The whole trip was quite pleasant, and I was quite satisfied with the food, accommodation and entertainment. The only thing I want to complain about is that when I purchased this itinerary, I was supposed to get a 100 discount for spending over 5,000, but in fact it was only a 50 discount. I contacted customer service and no one responded, which was a bit depressing. <br>Finally, here are some beautiful photos taken on Sunlight Rock on Gulangyu Island.

The bus station at the door has lines to various attractions, especially No. 87. It is super convenient to go to Zengcuo'an, Hulishan Fort, Xiamen University and Nanputuo Temple. There are also direct buses to Zhongshan Road. We arrived early and the hotel rushed to prepare the room for us. Although the room was not particularly big, the old man said it was comfortable. Breakfast is also quite unique, including fish ball soup, peanut soup and pork trotter noodles. The children like the swimming pool very much, and the husband likes the gym.

The transparent glass between the bedroom and the room is only covered by a layer of gauze, which is a bit embarrassing. The flight and pick-up at the airport were fine on the way out, but there was a typhoon on the way back and the flight was cancelled. The customer service helped solve the problem in the evening.

The rooms in Gulangyu Island are not good, very old, and far away from the central business district of Gulangyu Island. Breakfast is just a bowl of porridge and a boiled egg.

The service was relatively good. Our stay was very comfortable. We slept until we woke up naturally every day and went out for a walk. The ones in Xiamen are not delicious and the snacks are not to our taste. We still tried Zhang Sanfeng milk tea and Aunt Zhao’s pie. The seafood was pretty good. The big squid was worth trying. The coconut cake was delicious and we also bought it. Lots to come back to. Bougainvillea is very beautiful and can be found everywhere. It decorates the whole city. Facing Bicheng Harbor, Nanputuo is the most representative temple of southern Fujian Buddhism. It has strong architectural characteristics of southern Fujian. It is good to worship Buddha and experience Buddhist culture. The environment of Huandao Road is very beautiful. We rented a two-person bicycle and listened to the waves and the sea breeze. It was a good enjoyment to ride and listen along the way, appreciate the scenery along the way, and experience the marathon trip that everyone loves. We have also visited Sunlight Rock. It is the highest peak of Gulangyu Island and was named after Zheng Chenggong. When we stand on it, we can see the sky close at hand. We can lean on the railing and look far away, including Xiamen Island, Gulangyu Island, Dadan Island and Erdan Islands. All as far as the eye can see.

It’s all folded up, and it’s not bad to go out for fun, but it’s a little hot. The scenery of Xiamen Island on the Zengcuo’an side is better than that of Gulangyu Island. The seaside is very comfortable. Unfortunately, I didn’t go to Huandao Road to see it. I spent three days and three nights there. Some of the haste may be because we are lazy. Every time we go out, we stay in the hotel until noon. Many scenic spots are not visited.

2534,2534,"My husband had a few days off, so he took a quick trip. I checked online two days in advance. After comparison, I felt that the price for the same trip was the best. Since I had a child with me, I chose to stay at the Pan Pacific Hotel. I can definitely say that my choice was correct. Whether it was the marketing staff Wu Xiaosen or the customer service manager Zhou Haixia, I was very satisfied with their service attitude. I would like to remind everyone to confirm the itinerary. The earlier the better, the ticket price is variable. After I consulted on the first day, because I could not confirm it, when I booked the ticket the next day, it had increased by more than 600 yuan. So the earlier you book, the better the price will be. If you are bringing children, it is good to stay at the Pan Pacific Hotel. If you want to choose a twin room, you can put it together. The double room cannot accommodate 3 people. The hotel's swimming pool is outdoor and you can still swim at noon. The hotel is a five-star hotel, but it can't compare with the five-star hotels in Shenyang. The bathroom in the hotel is very luxurious. When the children were tired from playing, they took a bath in the evening and it was very happy. After leaving the airport, take a taxi to the hotel for about 35 yuan! The hotel is two stops away from the oil tanker terminal on Gulangyu Island and about 9 stops away from Xiamen University. There is a bus at the door, which is very convenient. My itinerary is to take a morning flight and arrive in Xiamen at around 2 o'clock. After arriving at the hotel, I put down my luggage and took the bus to Xiamen University. , after walking around, go to Furong Restaurant for some snacks, and then walk through Furong Tunnel. After coming out, take a taxi to Xiaojingshang to eat seafood, return to the hotel, and have a good rest. The next day, we had breakfast at the hotel, took a car to the cruise terminal, and took a boat to Gulangyu Island. After tasting various snacks, the children will be tired from walking, go back to the hotel, take a bath, and have a small hot pot at the restaurant opposite in the evening. On the third day, we took the bus in the direction of Xiamen University to visit the fort. It is best to get up early, have breakfast at 7 o'clock, and set off after 8 o'clock. There will be a performance at the fort at 10 o'clock, and the scene was not bad. After coming out, rent a bicycle and ride happily on the road around the island. Enjoy the view.",Postive

The hotel's breakfast is very rich, but there are height requirements for children who are taller than 1m and need to be charged separately. There are not many places to eat near the hotel. There is a nice Chaofu City opposite. I ate there 3 times, but the price was a bit expensive. You also have to pay a separate service fee and tea fee. You have to wait every time. There are so many people and the taste is great. good. The flight to Xiamen was on time, but the flight back to Jinan was much delayed due to the weather in Jinan. I used Air Travel Zongheng to keep track of the previous flight status and did not have to wait for a long time at the airport. Instead, I stayed in Xiamen for an extra afternoon.

He also left us a message and prepared slippers for the two children. However, I don’t know if there is something wrong with the sheets. The whole family will be there the next day. I have red spots and itching on my body, and the most annoying thing in Xiamen is the Didi Express. It always takes a detour, and I have to pay extra every time. In the end, it costs more than 80 yuan to get to the airport. I originally only paid 50 yuan. Damn it, the location of the hotel on Gulangyu Island would be better if it was closer. It is too far from the center and it is far from anywhere. It is close to Neicuo'ao Pier, but this pier is the farthest pier. Going to several scenic spots on Gulangyu Island and overlooking the sea are really beautiful and worth visiting. However, my friends who went there were prepared to keep walking. We spent two days walking along the seaside and our legs were almost useless. Ah, there is no car to ride on. I am tired and happy at the same time. I must visit the Huandao Road in Xiamen. It rained heavily that day, so we kept walking. It would be better if we could ride a bicycle. There are really many snacks, cream crabs. Most of them are not fat and are a bit rough, so you have to be careful and find a good restaurant to eat seafood. We ate at Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street and it was okay.

The star-rated hotel we booked was very good. If we book directly, it will cost about 800 yuan a day, but the same-trip package is very suitable, allowing us to experience a five-star hotel at an affordable price. The only drawback is that the hotel is located in a high-end area, so it will take some time to find affordable restaurants nearby. I was also quite satisfied with Tongcheng’s service. When we were about to leave, the person responsible for sending us off to the airport asked us to go to a designated location to get on the bus. It seemed that it was a ** who cooperated with Tongcheng. I was very unhappy after hearing this. After contacting Tongcheng, about half an hour later, they helped me get it done and sent two high-end cars to drop off the airport. <br>The highlight of this product is the star-rated hotel.

Every time I had a question, she got back to me in seconds and answered it as soon as possible. Okay, hahaha. I was a little unhappy at first. The hotel wanted a double room, but there was no one. They only had standard rooms. Later, when I went to the hotel, they told me that a sea view double room would cost more than 100 yuan. I changed it, but I really advise everyone to go to the standard room at least. I thought the standard room was spacious. Haha, I got up early because of something and ate the hotel’s breakfast, which was really delicious! I forgive all its faults, but the hotel's service is really good. You can choose your own air tickets, which is very considerate. I took a rest on the first day and then went to Zhongshan Road to eat. Everything I ate was delicious except for the lazy duck? ! It rained a little that day, but I really don’t have to worry about it. The rain in Xiamen stopped quickly. After breakfast the next day, I went to Baicheng Beach. After playing in the water, I rented a Harley electric scooter for 60 for an hour. If you don’t think it looks good, just rent it for 40. The scooter is convenient for riding around the island. In a small corner where Zeng An enters from the side, there is an uncle grilling oysters. They are delicious and cheap. I ate 20 of them. What other thick slices of beef are there? Anyway, they are all delicious. You can buy as many snacks as you want and eat as much as you want. I rode back at 4pm. My friend wanted to go see Nanputuo and went for a walk. I took the bus when I went back in the evening. It was a pity that I passed the bus while playing with my mobile phone. Fortunately, the terminal was not far from the hotel. We were walking far away and saw a convenience store, so we asked to buy some water. Then I saw the boss eating duck wings, so I bought one. Then I thought it was delicious, so I bought 10 more. The third day I went to Gulangyu Island because I was a student and didn’t buy a combo ticket to go to the attractions. They were both half-price, so I still ate and walked. When I got tired, I took a break and went to see the Organ Museum. Then I regretted it because it was boring. Then I went to Sunlight Rock and Haoyue. The combined ticket cost only 110. In the end, I still felt like sitting on the beach. More comfortable! ? On the fourth day, I went to see the Egret and ate in Chaofu City. It was really great! This is the best Hong Kong style tea snack I have ever tasted! ? Anyway, I highly recommend trying the barbecued pork meal buns, shrimp dumplings, and crispy squab. These are the three that I think are particularly delicious. In the afternoon, I walked around the coffee street and went into cousin Xie Na’s shop and sat down for a while. All in all, I ate it for about four days, but I was really happy because it was all delicious😋",Postive
2541,2541,"Overall, the hotel is good, after all, the five-star service. The morning tea noodles and fish ball noodles are delicious. The transportation nearby is also very convenient. There are buses. The maximum cost of taking a taxi to the scenic spot is 20, but you must prepare cash in advance. The deposit for two twin beds in the room is about 2,000 [reference]. <br>If you want to travel, there is a half-pavilion on Nanputuo Mountain that is highly recommended. It is a trail with few people. The scenery is great and overlooks Xiamen University! Speaking of Xiamen University, the most regrettable thing is that Xiamen University is closed, so there is no Vipassana. The opening will not be until November. The pier has also been moved, and you can take a bus directly to the ferry to Gulangyu Island. <br>There is a food stall next to Pier 2 that is particularly good. You must go there before 5 o'clock, otherwise you will not be able to get a seat. The dishes are affordable and delicious, very authentic, about 95 yuan per person. When ordering, you have to go to the aquatic product cabinet to order them, which is like fighting. Anyway, highly recommended! Promise you won’t regret it! <br>Speaking of food, don’t go to the small restaurants near Zhongshan Road in Xiamen. The oysters are good for three yuan each, but they are not delicious and not fresh. Except for the oysters, everything else is expensive and they play word games. ●^●Special**. <br>But to say that the most Xiamen-like meal was found on Baidu, it’s called Ayong BBQ, a medium-sized grilled fish for 80 yuan, and the four girls couldn’t eat it till they were full. The key is that we are all Nanjing crayfish, four per person. It's the kind that can be eaten without a pound of food. Anyway, the side dishes are rich and the fish is delicious. It's completely different from the ones near Zhongshan Road. It's delicious and affordable. I can't explain it! The boss was very kind. He was worried that our girl would be hungry, and even took care of us by giving us a free meal of seafood porridge. It was so delicious, but we felt so small. <br>Xiamen is great this time!",Postive

What I was dissatisfied with was that the package did not clearly state that we would stay on Gulangyu Island for the first night, and we chose a flight after 2 p.m., which resulted in a delay in the time to get to the island. I was not sure. I couldn’t book tickets in advance online, and it was easy to fog at night, so the ferry might be suspended. Then I asked Tongcheng to coordinate and change the check-in order. On the third day when I went to the island, I was asked to pay an extra 168 yuan per room. I was helpless. You can only make up for it, otherwise you may end up sleeping on the street on the first night. <br>Then there is the evaluation of Xiamen. It is really not worth going. Taxis in the city seriously refuse to take passengers. They don’t use the meter and just ask the price at will. Gulangyu Island, I walk around every day, uphill and downhill. The environment is not good, there are no attractions to see, and it is foggy all the time. I booked the outbound ferry directly online for 10:50 in the morning, and later saw it at 7:00 in the morning* *It was said that all sailings were suspended due to heavy fog. We were waiting for the resumption notice at 11 o'clock. Fortunately, we went to the ferry terminal according to the original plan and caught the 10:50 ferry. Otherwise, we would have to queue up again to buy tickets. . It was foggy again on the fourth day, and only Sanqiutian Pier was accessible.

First of all, the Wyndham Grand Hotel on the first night was really good. I was very satisfied with the hardware facilities and the service was very good. The perfume in the hotel smelled so comfortable, but the location was not very good. It is in Haicang District. You can take a boat to Xiamen in the morning. However, you can only take a taxi at night and it is still quite far. Overall, the hotel has good reviews! The hotels in Gulangyu Island are a bit inferior. They have a rather embarrassing theme hotel. There are only two bear dolls in the room. This is too hard to catch. Overall, it is average. The location is very good, right next to Sanqiutian Pier. Finally, the Pan Pacific Hotel is a good five-star hotel, but the rooms are a bit small and a bit old. Maybe the location is too high and there are more guests. The service is average and needs to be improved!",Postive
2736,2736,"This time I traveled with a large family, and I feel that Gulangyu Island is very suitable for family travel. The entire island is not big, but there are many places to visit, especially snacks and seafood. The Four Seasons Hotel where we live is very close to the pier, less than a five-minute walk away, and there are many seafood food stalls nearby. It's a pity that we can't eat seafood, we can only look at it with greed. There are a lot of snacks near Longtou Road, but it is also very crowded because there are more people coming to eat. Most of the stores are not big, so basically everyone just buys and leaves, and eats while walking. I like the small intestines wrapped in large intestines, shark balls, rice rolls and seafood barbecue, but I personally don’t like them very much. Walking on the beach in the morning and evening is indeed very peaceful. As for the subsequent trip to Xiamen, it was not as special as Gulangyu Island. I went to Xiamen University and Nanputuo. The Furong Tunnel of Xiamen University was quite worth visiting, as it brought back many memories of university.

After coming out of the airport lobby, I got into a taxi and arrived at the hotel not long after. The fare is 38 yuan...well, Xiamen Island may be relatively small. The room service at the Pan Pacific Hotel is good. The warm reception and thoughtful arrangements made us enjoy the journey. If you have any questions about the journey, you can directly ask the front desk, such as where are the real glasses... (cheap and super delicious) seafood food stalls)!

I heard from a local taxi driver that it was difficult to book a ferry ticket to Gulangyu Island. As a result, this problem was not a big deal in the eyes of the front desk (it is best to make a reservation one day in advance)... There are quite a lot of people and there are too many teams... .<br>The hotel on Gulangyu Island has an outdoor swimming pool. Except for the slightly smaller bathroom, I personally think it meets the standards.

When I went to the hotel, I was told that the reservation was a standard room. I don’t know what went wrong, but I As evidenced by phone recordings with customer service, two adults with a 2-year-old child could only be temporarily upgraded to a deluxe king bed room; another, the flight was slightly delayed due to weather conditions, especially the return flight, and they were stranded on the plane for two hours after arrival. But the weather had nothing to do with it. What was relevant was asking customer service before the flight whether it would affect the journey. As a result, there was no enthusiasm at all when booking. The chat stopped abruptly, and there was no reply for a long time. There are screenshots of the chat records to prove it. No more pictures. <br>I have said a lot, everything else is very good. Xiamen is a city worth traveling to. It does not rip off customers or bully students. It is neither big nor small.

I have to say that choosing Tongcheng this time was the right choice. This free trip included air tickets and hotels. First of all, the price was very suitable. Because I had my baby with me, I chose a five-star hotel. After I checked in, I specifically asked about the hotel’s custom price, which was more than 800 per day. If we travel the same way, we will save more than 200 yuan a day. The hotel is located on the seaside of Xiamen. There is a bay park just one stop away. I took my children to play there. The scenery is very good and there are also beach and sand play facilities. The most important thing is that it is only one stop away. It is really convenient. I feel that the hotel's service is worthy of a five-star rating. The downside is that the neighborhood seems to be a place where foreigners gather. There are a lot of high-end consumers and there are very few affordable restaurants. After two days of searching, I found a few affordable supermarkets very close to the hotel. and restaurants. <br>In addition, I especially want to praise Tongcheng's service. Because the order was in a hurry, I got the wrong name on the ticket class, and two waves of people were made into two orders, so I made many calls to Tongcheng. Everything was solved very well. Fortunately, I didn’t have to go to the airport and negotiate with the hotel by myself. With Tongcheng as my backer, many problems can be solved ^_^. The time and attitude of the reply made me feel very good. I hope Tongcheng can continue to carry forward this kind of customer-is-God service. I hope these messages can help others.

The above three places are close together. If the weather is not hot, you can also ride a bicycle on the Huandao Road next to Xiamen University. We will spend the whole day on Gulangyu Island the next day. It is recommended to book your boat tickets online. You can rent an audio tour guide before going to the island. There is a regular tour guide for 100 yuan at the door after you go to the island. Walk a little further in and you can get a tour guide for 30 yuan. The tour guides are probably residents of the island. We did not invite them. However, since the residential areas on the island occupy a large area, in order to save time and money, we can secretly follow the tour guides. Following them can Pass through the residential area to reach the scenic spot in the shortest time.

I visited several scenic spots, including the Piano Museum and Sunlight Rock, but I wasn’t happy to climb them. To be honest, I was more interested in snack bars and trinket shops. There are countless shops of this type, including fruits, yogurt, seafood, etc. The prices are all reasonable prices. After leaving the island, I went to the Little Eyes Food Stall. It was actually a restaurant level, without the atmosphere of a food stall at all. I ordered curry crab, squid, snails, mushroom pot, two bottles of beer, and a flying pancake, a total of about 250, and the taste was great.

What is particularly disgusting is that Xiamen is an extremely impersonal place. You are charged for a glass of boiled water or a napkin when you eat. I have never seen such a charge anywhere in the country. Fortunately, Gulangyu Island is quite interesting. Sunlight Rock, Shuzhuang Garden, Shell Dream World and Ocean World are all unique, but the tickets are a bit more expensive than similar attractions in other cities. All in all, Xiamen left a very bad impression on us, and we probably won’t go to this city again. On the return trip, a special car came to pick us up, but there was no air conditioning. We were as hot as if we were sitting in a steamer. The driver said that they were losing money on the airport pick-up, so they saved what they could. The four-day trip is over. The service provided by Tongcheng is very attentive, with text messages and reminders from time to time, but the airport pick-up and drop-off service needs to be improved.",Postive

The worst impression is that the taxis in Xiamen are not managed by anyone. There are black cars everywhere. Those who don’t check the meter wherever they go will just tell them the price and directly call out the price. Many places still refuse to accept passengers.

It can only accommodate one person. It is a little inconvenient to bathe children. The hotel's customer service staff are of good quality. They found that there were children's belongings in the room and specially prepared small slippers. One day I carelessly left several thousand dollars on the table and forgot to put them away. I was originally worried that the money would be taken away, but when I came back I found the money wrapped in an envelope and placed on the bedside table. I really have to praise the customer service for this. . Before leaving, a child accidentally broke the lampshade on the bedside table while playing. I told the hotel staff when I checked out that I was ready to pay for it, but the room manager first asked if the child was injured and made sure that the child was not injured. The children celebrating the New Year were lucky enough not to be injured, so there is no need to pay compensation for this lampshade. A very user-friendly hotel, thumbs up again.

The environment in 141 is not easy to find and it’s not as good as small glasses. This makes me choose a place where I would rather spend more. The botanical garden is also a must-see. ——Wanshi Botanical Garden is the best place to visit when visiting Xiamen. There are many plants that have never been seen in the north, as well as tropical rainforests——Xiamen University, the Furong Tunnel is quite long, and the Furong Restaurant is so cheating...it’s cheap That's right, but there's no good stuff! ———— Regarding the accommodation in Gulangyu Island, it was originally Four Seasons Like Spring and later changed to Wanjia (Bowen Bear Theme Hotel). I changed rooms twice. The first time was that the room had a very strong smell, and the second time was because of mosquitoes. Too many, at least 200... The things on Gulangyu Island are really expensive... and they are not as delicious as the legend... It cost nearly 1,000 to buy specialties... A box of six snacks is 45 per box, and 125g nougat is 45 per box... Scented tea costs 1.25 per gram. Please note that it is 1g... I suggest you just try it a little and stop. Listen to my advice. You must be obedient! ————On the last night we stayed in Pullman, a packed breakfast was prepared at 4:50 because our flight was at 6:25.

Usually, taking a taxi is not as convenient as public transportation, but in the morning there are many taxis waiting in front of the hotel, waiting for guests to be taken to the airport and train station! Xiamen is not big, and the hotel is near the city government, not far from Xiamen University, Zhongshan Road, and Gulangyu Ferry! The only regret is that it is not suitable to go to Xiamen in the summer, especially with children. It is too hot. Xiamen University and Gulangyu are very crowded.

The fine, and third, the total driving time of renting a car for two days was less than 100 kilometers, which felt not worth it. It’s just a more convenient place to take children and the elderly.

The flight was delayed two hours when I left, but I came back on time. Xiamen was very hot during the day, and the kids couldn't stand it. They basically didn't play, so they swam on the third floor of the hotel. The swimming pool was very clean. I made the reservation with the customer service of the same trip. Two notes are required. The room had an adjoining king bed. Because the two children wanted to play, when we arrived at the hotel, they suggested that we add more than 100 yuan a day to upgrade the room. I didn’t think it was necessary and didn’t add it. She said there was no adjoining room, and I said the same. Floors are OK, but the front desk said there are no rooms on the same floor, so we had to live on the 13th floor and the 15th floor. I guess it was intentional because I didn’t pay extra. I paid for the room, so why couldn’t they reserve a good room for me? Only with a free membership card can you get unlimited internet in the room. I took a taxi from the airport. Because there were so many people, I took a larger rental with a starting price of 20 yuan, and it was 49 yuan to the hotel. The room I stayed in was raining, and the sewer and wash basin were clogged. The water drained very slowly. I told the room attendant and arranged it immediately. It's been repaired, it's not bad, but why aren't the rooms cleaned every morning? She was taking a nap there in the afternoon, and the door was unlocked. When she suddenly came in to clean, she was startled, and so was I. The buffet every morning was okay, but not as exciting as rated. Xiamen is not a big city, so we basically use Didi every day to travel, which is very convenient. The roads to Zhongshan Road and Xiamen University are very congested, with two lanes, and the traffic jams are tiring. I didn’t even go to Xiamen University. I went to the nearby Baicheng Beach to take my children to play in the sand at night. I booked the ferry ticket to Gulangyu Island and didn’t go around much. It was too hot and the kids couldn’t bear it, so I went back to the hotel at noon. Walking a little to the left of the hotel, there are two stops at the entrance of KFC, No. 87 and L5. The bottom stop is Xiagu Pier. The hotel The Chaofulou restaurant opposite is quite delicious, but the portions are not large. The four of us and two of us spent more than 600 yuan on snacks. The next day we went to Little Eyes on Hubin Middle Road to eat seafood. The price/performance ratio was good and it was very fresh. I don’t like seafood, but it would be a waste not to eat seafood in Xiamen, so I ordered more than 500 yuan of seafood, but I didn’t eat a lot of it, it was a waste. For example, the famous bamboo shoot jelly was unpalatable**! It's made of worms, like ice jelly, I don't like the taste. Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street was overcrowded, and it was impossible to get a taxi. Only after calling Didi did we get a taxi. When we returned to the hotel from Xiamen-Guzhou Pier, the taxi waiting there refused to take us to Pan Pacific and refused to take us there. I guess it was because it was too close, damn it! Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street is also quite old, and I don’t think there is much to visit. There are very few large supermarkets in Xiamen, and there are many small convenience stores and small imported food supermarkets. There are several in the alley next to the hotel, as well as beef noodles, porridge shops, and barbecues. , Korean restaurant. The driver said that the hotel belongs to the wealthy area of ​​Xiamen. There is a small town called Lukang on the road opposite the hotel, and the food is quite delicious, which is more in line with our appetite. This trip to Xiamen felt that we wasted it. We didn’t play the places we should have played. It was a waste! People recommended sailing at Guanyin Mountain, and there is a free Xiamen Children's Park in Haicang, but we didn't go there.",Postive

Considering that there are many people on Gulangyu Island during the Dragon Boat Festival, I arranged a staggered trip from June 7th to 10th. After booking, I discussed with Tongcheng’s customer service to stay in Gulangyu Island for the first night. , I stayed in Xiamen Island for the next 2 nights, and the same trip was arranged very well. They sent me text messages and emails 3 days before departure to tell me the entire itinerary, including flight time, hotel address, and pick-up arrangements. It was very considerate. <br>June 7th: The flight at 10:50 am arrived at noon. We arranged a bus to send it to Dongdu Wharf. We took a boat to Neicuoao Pier on Gulangyu Island and walked for 3 minutes after exiting the pier. It only takes 3 minutes and we are there on the same journey. The arranged Four Seasons Hotel is a high-end hotel on Gulangyu Island. There is a beach in front of the hotel. After chink in, we started to visit Shuzhuang Garden, Piano Museum, Aberdeen Back Beach, Longtou Road for dinner, and then returned to the hotel. rest. <br>June 8: After breakfast at 7 o'clock in the morning, we went to Sunlight Rock. At 11 o'clock, we returned to the hotel and had a rest. Then we took a boat back to Xiamen Island. We took a taxi from Dongdu Wharf to Xiamen Powerlong Birman for 11 yuan. Grand hotel, this hotel is a 5-star hotel. The hotel environment, room facilities, hotel services, and hotel breakfast are all excellent. There is also Bailuzhou Park at the door of the hotel and a swimming pool on the B1 floor. After lunch, we went to Jimei Mei Village, Mastiff Garden, Tan Kah Kee’s former residence, and Zhongshan Road in the afternoon. We also went for a swim in the swimming pool when we came back in the evening. The hotel bed is very soft and comfortable. <br>On the morning of June 9th, I enjoyed a sumptuous breakfast prepared by the hotel. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel, which is very convenient for traveling. Today I visited Xiamen University, Baicheng Beach, Zengcuo'an, Huandao Road Seaside, Hulishan Fort, Zhongshan After dinner, return to hotel to rest. <br>I slept until I woke up naturally and enjoyed breakfast at the hotel on June 10. On the last day, it rained in Xiamen in the morning. The rain stopped after we had breakfast. This morning we played in Bailuzhou Park in front of the hotel. , there were very few people there, and there was a large lake in the park. After enjoying ourselves, we checked out of the room and waited in the hotel lobby for the special car arranged to take us to the airport.

It is worth using Tongcheng when traveling!",Postive

This quickly alleviates people's idea of ​​​​going to Gulangyu Island after arriving in Xiamen. <br>The transportation and hotel arrangements for the second trip are very good. There are two flights to travel, and pick-up and drop-off are arranged after arriving at the destination, which is very convenient. Especially the hotel arrangement. The ""Four Seasons Like Spring"" hotel on Gulangyu Island is very close to Neicuo'ao Pier. It takes five minutes to get off the pier and is very easy to find. The ""Powerlong Pullman"" hotel in the city is a five-star hotel with convenient transportation (in Bailuzhou).

They also contacted me via text message in advance for airport pick-up. However, I took a taxi myself and did not use the airport pick-up service, so it is inconvenient to comment. The Pan Pacific I stayed at was okay. Although the room was light and ventilated, it was clean and tidy. The transportation was also convenient. Breakfast was free for children under 1.2 meters tall. Of course, I am not satisfied with my trip to Xiamen. In addition to the weather, the most important thing is the traffic. Xiamen’s public transportation is indeed very developed, and you can basically take the bus, but the traffic jam is also terrible. On the first day on Friday night It actually took more than two hours to take the eight-stop bus. The return ticket at 8:40 was actually delayed until 11:00.

After arriving at the airport, a car will pick you up on the same journey (note: you will be notified by text message on the first night). The drive from Gaoqi Airport to Pan Pacific Hotel takes about 20 to 25 minutes. The hotel service is friendly, the check-in procedure is quick, and the sanitary environment is good. <br> When I had free time in the afternoon, I took a taxi (12 yuan) and went to Zhongshan Road Commercial Street and Taiwan Snack Street, which mainly have a variety of snacks. In the evening, I ate seafood at Laoucheng Snack Street (note: discounts are available through ** reservations). I want to take a taxi back to the hotel in the evening (note: it’s difficult, many drivers refuse to take me. I don’t know why, maybe the fare is less, you can choose the bus). <br> On the second day of travel, I got up early and walked to the nearby Xiagu Cruise Center Pier (known locally as Dongdu Pier) to prepare to go to Gulangyu Island. When I arrived, I was told that the ferry would not leave until 10:50 (it was only 8:15 at the time) points) I don’t know why! According to the timetable, the bus departs every 20 minutes. When I saw the time, it was still early and I took a taxi to the Zhongshan Road Ferry Terminal. I was told that this pier is only open to locals, and I had to use my ID card to buy tickets! When I was at a loss, there were many scalpers nearby who said that a boat was about to leave and they could help buy tickets. After spending 80 yuan, I was taken to a less obvious first pier (about 300 meters away from Zhongshan Road Pier). After spending 2 yuan, we took the ferry to Songyu Pier, and then swiped our ID card (the scalper just booked it online, but it was actually a 30 round-trip ticket, and the scalper made 50, which is a scam), and finally arrived at Gulangyu Island. Everyone has the scenic spots in Gulangyu Island. Go and see for yourself, I'm not in the mood that day anyway, I can just come back to any pier. <br> On the third day of the trip, the Huli Mountain Fort was okay. There was a performance around 10:00 in the morning with various cannons. You can rent a bicycle at the entrance of Hulishan Fort and ride along the Huandao Road. You can enjoy the scenery along the way. You can return the bicycle to Zengcuo'an. There are alley-style snacks in Zengcuo'an. The variety is similar to that of Zhongshan Road Snack Street. Xiamen University recommends Go on weekends, otherwise you will be exhausted from queuing. The opening hours are from 12:00 to 14:00 and after 17:30. Because I couldn't stand the queue, I went to the nearby Nanputuo Temple. There is no need to buy tickets for the temple, and there are no commercial vendors. In this way, the third day is over<br> On the fourth day, there is still half a day to play, but the physical load is too much. I rest in the hotel and prepare to go home.

I had to take a ferry from Xiamen. Although there were boats available 24 hours a day, it was always dark and late at night. It’s terrible for someone who is unfamiliar with the place. Even if you pay more, you have to change it! The plane is a new one, and the windows are not partitions, but magical light and dark adjustment windows. When adjusted to the darkest level, it feels like being outside the window at night, magical! I don’t comment on airplane food, everyone knows how bad airplane food is! <br>The Four Seasons Spring Hotel in Gulangyu should be a three-star hotel. The courtyard-style environment is not bad, but the bath water is not hot. The draft in the room is too strong. It still feels chilly with the air conditioner on. I am from Beijing, and it is minus 17 degrees. On the third day, I ran to Xiamen, but I felt that the room was very cold. My guy almost caught a cold, so I gave him a bag of cold medicine and covered him with a quilt all night before he felt better! The hotel has breakfast, but I felt uncomfortable at home, so I didn’t eat until I got up. I won’t comment on the breakfast. The hotel service is good, they are all very friendly and always available! <br>There are many unique B&Bs in the local area. You can stay in a B&B next time to better experience local life. However, the room may be damp, so lower the tide! <br>There is nothing to say about Sheraton Xiamen. After all, it is a five-star hotel. The breakfast is very rich, the party building is super good, and the shower facilities are very authentic. The only drawback is that the room smells full of moisture. The first room we stayed in, room 1509, had a strong smell of moisture. We I requested to change it to 1503. Although there is a damp smell, it is acceptable! <br>Because the return flight was at noon, the time was right so we didn’t pay extra for the exchange. It turned out to be a low-cost airline. You can’t check in and choose your own seats. There is a charge of 90 yuan for checked luggage of 11 to 15 kilograms.

The sailboat... finally sent us to Zengcuo'an for dinner. On the third day, I visited Gulangyu Island. The road was uphill and downhill. It was a bit tiring to walk with children, so I didn’t buy a combined ticket. We played in the underwater world and saw the statue of Zheng Chenggong. On the morning of the fourth day, I went to Zhongshan Park, which also has a children's playground and a zoo. Admission is free. Because I had children and it was still raining outside, I discussed with the hotel about checking out at 2 pm, and the hotel agreed.

The intervals between high and low tides on the beach were quite short. I also went to Ocean Park, which is quite a small park. Although the seafood on the island was not very expensive in five hours, it was enough to eat alone. I didn’t eat the rest because I wasn’t used to it. Besides, vegetables are really expensive... I left Gulangyu Island at noon the next day and went to Nan Putuo and Xiamen University in the afternoon. Nan Putuo is worth visiting, and the scenery of Wulaofeng behind is also good.

Are stewardess salaries too high? . . <br><br>The Wyndham Hotel is good, a newly opened hotel, but when I arrived at the hotel, I was told that the double bed room booked for me on the same trip was no longer available. I had to change it to an executive room. The balcony that should have been there was no longer available. The location of the hotel is very far away. We went there for a 180° sea view room, but we haven't gotten one yet, which makes us feel bad. But I gave you some late-night snacks and some drinks and desserts from the self-service bar. But it's still not as good as a sea view room with a balcony. The outdoor swimming pool is very good, the water is clean, and it is comfortable to lie on the edge and bask in the sun. The service guys and girls greet the guests when they see them, which feels good. Also, there were bugs on the bathrobe in the room. . . A long yellow bug the size of a fingernail. . .

2824,2824,"I am generally satisfied with my travel plan this time. Let me talk about the hotel first. Although the room is not big, the service is very good. The breakfast is very rich. The location is also good. It is very convenient to go to various attractions. There are public buses when we go out. We travel a lot. The special car for 7 people is very convenient. The small glasses restaurant is indeed well-deserved, cheap and good. It is a must to go to Xiamen to taste delicious food. Bonus points, I won’t say much more about Gulangyu Island. I regret not going there, and I regret even more if I go. The 5 days and 4 nights trip is more than enough for Xiamen. Unexpectedly, the arrival of the typhoon delayed the flight for 3 days. Here are my thoughts on the same trip. I hope that next time we encounter an emergency, we can inform you as soon as possible and help coordinate, instead of informing you and then issuing a series of exemptions. After struggling for a day, you can only give us a refund. You must know that we booked a round trip. Is it necessary to change the ticket? Is it so difficult for such a big platform? We can only wait three more days because of our impatience. I would like to mention that the customer service is quite patient. It would be better if the reply does not take so long. I promised to respond before 9 o'clock in the morning. There was no proactive reply until 11 o'clock. We were actively calling to inquire all the way. However, customer service came one after another, saying that we wanted to ask the customer service for the order. Oh my God, I was speechless. It was a long wait again. If I could just do this Wouldn't it be better if we could improve things in this area? Well, the unpleasant things ended in a day's war of words. In the end, I left Xiamen and transferred to Zhangzhou Yunshuiyao. The mountains and rivers here are beautiful and the air is good. I personally must go to Xiamen. I must go here for a walk. It’s really nice. Anyway, we got home safely. Let’s give it a good review.",Postive

2826,2826,"It was a great independent trip. Because my husband and I were traveling together with our 5-year-old son and 15-month-old daughter, it was more convenient to book an independent trip and I could manage my time easily! <br>When we arrived at Xiamen, it was easy to find a pick-up person, but the round trip usually took about an hour. When we arrived, the previous flight might have just left, so we waited at the airport for about an hour before leaving for the hotel. Because it was my first time to travel with two babies, in order to take better care of the babies, I chose the five-star old brand Sheraton, which was generally okay. I arrived at the hotel around 5 o'clock in the afternoon. When I checked in at the front desk, I specifically told them that I wanted a non-smoking room (because I read a lot of guides and reviews in the early stage). It turned out that there was only a non-smoking room, and I could only get it as soon as 40 minutes later. Check-in...<br>The next day, the destination was Xia University. I went there on the ninth day of the Lunar New Year. I thought it was the off-season. But when I arrived at the gate of Xia University, I was surprised by the long queue of people at the door. The general opening hours may be From 12:00 to 14:00 noon, it was during the release period when we arrived. It felt no less than a stampede on the Bund, ha! It’s a bit exaggerated, but the crowds are real. Because it’s really inconvenient to take part in the excitement with children, I decided to give up on Xia Da Gai and walk to the beach near Xia Da Gai. For children, this attraction is also More attractive than Xia Da. The weather was still a bit cool that day, but it did not deter the father and the eldest child from the urge to go barefoot to the sea and have close contact with the sea. Even the baby took off her shoes and played happily on the beach. The husband and the two children They all had a great time! After that, I took the bus to Zhongshan Road and started to go to the foodie mode. I even had lunch and dinner together. It was quite difficult to take a taxi back to the hotel on Zhongshan Road around 5 pm (because I was a little tired with big bags and small bags, so I didn’t choose the bus again). The taxis at the door are quite awesome. I don’t know why they drove away as soon as they heard about that place. I couldn’t hail a taxi even though I used a taxi app. After waiting for about half an hour, I finally got a taxi. , the price on the clock was about 36 yuan, and the driver insisted on asking us for 40 yuan. We had no choice but to endure it, and I felt grateful to be able to get on the bus! <br>On the third day, the destination is Gulangyu Island. The ferry ticket was booked on ** a few days in advance (pay attention to Xiamen Lundu Co., Ltd.). You swipe your ID card to board the boat about 20 minutes before the boat sails. We chose to dock at Sanqiutian Wharf because it is relatively close to the snack street, and after visiting the snack street that day, my son lost interest and hurried back to the hotel, only staying on the island for two days. After about an hour, we returned. We didn’t visit any of the major attractions, which was a pity! <br>On the fourth day, the flight left at 12 o'clock, and I made an appointment with the driver to pick me up at around 9 o'clock. The front desk checked out very efficiently. The trip was almost over, but after finally boarding the plane on time, the captain told air traffic control that the departure would be delayed for about an hour and a half. It was okay to wait in the terminal, and we had to wait in the plane. Fortunately, the babies behaved well. Great! ! ! <br>My babies and I returned home safely.

There is a swimming pool on the third floor of the hotel, which is quite grand. The breakfast in the hotel's restaurant is very good, with many varieties. My children love the French pancakes the most, and they eat them till full every morning. The customer service is warm and thoughtful, making people feel friendly. The Pan Pacific Hotel is located on Hubin North Road, Siming District, Xiamen. Not far away is the Xiamen-Gulang Island Cruise Terminal. It is very convenient to buy tickets and travel to Gulangyu Island. There are convenience stores and small restaurants downstairs on the left side, which are very good.

Due to the cancellation of flights due to the typhoon, I stayed in Xiamen for two more days. Due to the restriction of subsidized prices, the available hotels were relatively average. This still caused some minor flaws in this trip. Finally, I would like to praise the service of my exclusive travel consultant Xiaoyan. The service attitude is good and the response is timely.

As for airlines, I think Sichuan Airlines has disappointed me a bit. The space between the front and rear rows is small, and the backs of the seats are uncomfortable. The air-conditioning is too cold at the airport and it is too hot when flying. Moreover, when the flight was delayed due to a typhoon, we couldn't hear the announcement at the airport.

The Chinese restaurant on the third floor has good food but is a bit expensive. There is a bus station not far from the door. It is very convenient to go to Zhongshan Road, Xiamen University and Cuocuo'an. Xiamen is a slow-paced place that needs to be enjoyed slowly.

Sanqiutian is open 24 hours a day. There are no flights from Neichuo until 6:40 pm, but the two piers are a bit far apart. Before going to the island, you must consider which pier you will come back from. There are many snack bars on the island, and Huang Shengji Shacha Noodles is good. There are also many shopping stores on the island, such as Ms. Zhao’s shop and Jasmine Tong Pie. It’s cheaper to buy here than at Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street.

The beach is right in front of the hotel, so Coca-Cola is too much for the kids. The 3-night stay at the Powerlong Pullman in Xiamen has an absolutely first-class environment. It is surrounded by a free park. The only drawback is that it is a little far from the downtown area. It is worth mentioning that it happened that a relative of ours had a birthday while we were staying at the hotel, and the hotel took the initiative to give us a quite large birthday cake, which was very thoughtful. The hotel's buffet breakfast was very good. We also tried the buffet dinner. The seafood was very fresh.

The text message reminded that the pick-up was by bus, and the drop-off was specifically picked up at the hotel. 3-Tongcheng initially booked the wrong hotel order, but it was quickly solved after calling. 4-The return flight was delayed by more than an hour, and it took a long time at the airport. 5 -Others: It is difficult to take a taxi after leaving Gulangyu Island and arriving at the pier.

They both have their own outdoor swimming pools and the environmental facilities are very satisfactory. Gulangyu Villa Hotel has a special place to dry clothes. The clothes will dry after a while, which is much better than drying indoors in the shade. Pan Pacific is located in the urban area and has better facilities.

The guy who picked me up at the airport was also on time and his service attitude was really good. There is nothing on Gulangyu Island. The only bright spot is that the greening in Xiamen and Gulangyu Island is really good. Things are too expensive, and the water at the beach is very dirty. I don't want to go down there.

The hotel on my trip was very good, three nights of five-star accommodation, including breakfast. The free buffet breakfast was very good, and the market price was 138 yuan/person. The only shortcoming this time is the airport drop-off service, which is a carpool pick-up and drop-off. When I dropped off the airport, my flight was originally at 7:55. If I needed the airport drop-off service and needed to share a car with other passengers, I would have to depart from the hotel at 5:00! I had no choice but to take a taxi to the airport!

The seafood is really cheap, but it is not cheap to eat seafood in Xiaojingshen. The three of us ate for 800 and didn't eat much. Zeng Cuo'an is still more cost-effective and the shopping time is shorter. Yes, there are many places that I only had a quick look at, but I didn’t have time to experience the beauty of Xiamen in detail!

It only takes five minutes to reach Neicuo’ao Pier, so I personally think that staying at the Four Seasons Hotel is worth the air ticket to Xiamen before 5 o’clock. The Pan Pacific Hotel at the back is quite good. There is a perfume lily tower at the entrance. It is fragrant and beautiful. The service staff are also very enthusiastic. It is a pity that there is no indoor swimming pool.",Postive

I was satisfied with my trip to Gulangyu Island. The only downside was that I was taken to a gangster restaurant for dinner by a gangster tour guide. It was ridiculously expensive and cost more than 1,300 for four people. The normal charge is about 600-700. Please be careful of those unscrupulous tour guides when you go out in the future. They kept following us and refused to leave, saying that the tour guide fee was only 30 yuan. When I heard the price, I felt a little confused at first, but I didn’t expect it to be so bad. The quality of the people of Xiamen is disappointing. She alone has a bad influence... In short, Tongcheng's service and entertainment are ok. I will still choose Tongcheng next time I go out.",Postive

I would like to sincerely tell anyone who wants to go, if you are too old or too young, don’t go. It all depends on your feet, and the road conditions are all uneven stone roads. It was a hot day and the sun was shining brightly. , basically exposed to the sun, the tour guide urges you to move forward like a duck, and you can see the flowers all the way, because there is really not enough time, the round trip takes ten hours, and the scenic spots can only take two and a half hours, which is really tiring , got up early and went back very late. The next day's itinerary was on Gulangyu Island, because the ferry ticket time was limited to 11:30 noon, and we had to queue up to board the boat under the scorching sun. Fortunately, we upgraded to stay in Gulangyu Island for one night, otherwise we would have to rush to the duck, and the tour guide Xiaolin's service was not very good. , always saying this is not fun, that is not fun, and only recommends attractions that require buying tickets with him?

There is no solution for when guests are unable to check in due to unknown reasons, resulting in tourists being unable to check in for a long time or not staying in a hotel! 3. Poor vehicle handover and vehicle arrangement resulted in no drop-off. During the peak tourism period, the corresponding pressure can be imagined when tourists from all over the country travel together. However, under such circumstances, the government should improve its business capabilities and emergency response capabilities, and require tour guides to be more cohesive and coordinated. strength and ability to handle events.

On the sixth day, the airport pick-up man came to the hotel on time to pick us up and take us to the airport. Generally speaking, the locals in Xiamen are quite enthusiastic, but the city is too commercial. There are more tourists, and there are people everywhere. Arrangements for the same journey are more worry-free. The service of tour guides needs to be improved. Don’t forget to say that you can help tourists negotiate prices wherever you go...",Neutral

It was strange that I could receive their phone calls but not the text messages. Wasn't the number wrong? <br>3. The hotel is Jingyu Hotel, with a retail price of 188. It is very old and unclean. There are old hairs on the carpet, moldy moss on the bathroom window sill, and there is a KTV in the same building. And when I signed up for the group, I saw other people commenting that they were staying at Zhongshan Road. When I arrived at the hotel, I didn’t know how far it was from Zhongshan Road. <br>4. The same itinerary said that there would be roasted pork rice dumplings for free, but I didn’t see it. There was mention of Xiamen University, but the tour guide didn’t even know we had this itinerary. I took a taxi to Xiamen University and Nanputuo Temple by myself<br> Advantages:<br>1. The hotel is very close to the subway, and it should be surrounded by a small village. There are a lot of food and fruit stalls at night, but the quality is at the level of a village<br>2. Director Zhou is a small woman. Although he is not smart enough, he is quite kind. On the third day of our free trip, he even asked if he would take us to a free classic tour<br>3.

When he went back the next day, there was still no room arranged. He contacted customer service to arrange it. Well, the old man was originally worried about traveling by himself.

It was inconvenient if you wanted to go to Zhongshan Road or something. This increased the cost. Next time the hotel will Choosing a city center location will be much more convenient for the elderly. In particular, I would like to give a small thumbs up to the customer service staff. They are very enthusiastic and responsible. They are very considerate of customers and help me solve problems immediately. I changed tour guides once in the middle and they were all good.

The itinerary of Gulangyu Island was unreasonable. We set off after 10 o'clock in the morning and queued up to go to the island at 12:30. It took us an hour to have lunch.

Some of the attractions are the same and some are different. If you want to go together with the same ones, if you are different, you will have to pay for the ticket or the tour guide will give you a time for you to move freely somewhere.

The buffet breakfast is average and there are not many kinds. The island mainly sells various special snacks. Each one costs about 25 yuan, and the cost is medium to high. , and it is particularly circuitous. Be sure not to eat seafood on the island. The price is high and the taste is bad. You can buy the boat ticket directly. Children who do not need to buy tickets need to go to the counter to get the children's ticket. The comments about Xiamen University are all hype, and they are all trolls. The Furong Tunnel is very long and full of various paintings. The paintings are pretty good, but it’s very difficult to get to the middle. I can’t figure out how to get out. I can only laugh when riding around the island. You can't see the sea during the whole process. It's just a marathon track, all uphill. Baicheng Beach has no characteristics and the water is not clear. If you go to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street to buy clothes, forget it. It's better to go for fun. Zengcuo'an is better. If compared with Gulangyu Island, the small shops are not much different. They don't spare the road and are not tiring. The cleaning lady at Panji Hotel has a very bad attitude. When she got up at night after breakfast, she kept knocking on the door to ask for cleaning. It was so urgent. I forgot to bring a leather strap when I checked out. I threw it directly at my feet and asked if I wanted more. The attitude was quite unqualified. I went to the Garden Museum and it was pretty good, but it was too big a few times. The scenery was amazing. The main thing inside was The buildings in various cities are pretty good outside of Japan. Others are not worth seeing. Suzhou in China is pretty good, but time was too tight so we didn’t visit them all. We walked around for 3 and a half hours.

You must know that hotels in Xiamen are almost full on Saturdays. After negotiating with Tongcheng, they helped me rebook a room. Otherwise, if the room is fully booked, where will the user sleep?

The environment is very good and it is very suitable for taking children to walk and play. However, the room is a bit cold and there is a problem with the air conditioning. Later they provided electric heating. It was much warmer in there and the service was very good. Seeing that we had children, we were given two extra bottles of mineral water every day. The conditions of the hotels on Gulangyu Island are much worse, and the service is not bad, but the overall facilities are much worse. The advantage is that it is very close to the pier. The disadvantage is that it is very noisy.

Later, we were told that we had to wait for an hour, so we gave up and took a taxi to the hotel. This arrangement was very unreasonable. <br>Finally, I suggest that since we have arranged a five-star hotel in the front, we should try to arrange a better hotel on the island later. We have already spent the money. I don’t mind spending a little more to stay in a better hotel, otherwise the overall feeling will be poor.

Check-in there had to be at two o'clock in the afternoon, so my luggage had to be stored at the concierge first. <br>The first day: I went to Xiamen University first. I couldn’t go in there because I had just entered the university these days. It’s a pity. Then I went to Nanputuo. It was full of people. Young people like us were basically You can go inside and take photos. If you go to Baicheng Beach, you can just walk on the edge of the beach. The water is very yellow and a bit dirty.

Shredded squid is almost 40 yuan per catty. If you want to buy specialty products, I suggest you visit a few more stores to compare prices. <br>The next day: I went to Gulangyu Island and bought the ticket on the Internet. The round-trip ferry ticket was 50 yuan. Every time I got on the boat, I was squeezed in. There were so many people. There are a lot of walks on the island, so it is recommended to wear a pair of sports shoes, otherwise it will be too much. There are many alleys inside, which is very convenient for navigation. It is not recommended to buy specialties on the island. You can go to Zeng Cuo'an for more affordable prices. There are only two flavors of Zhang Sanfeng's milk tea, one is the original flavor and the other is black tea. It is recommended to buy the original flavor. If you taste the black tea flavor, just taste it and throw it away. Personally, I think it is not generally unpalatable. There are some restaurants like Ms. Zhao and Zhang Sanfeng. Two or three. <br>The third day: I went cycling on Huandao Road again. Two single bikes cost 80 yuan a day. You can bargain, but you can’t ride for long because it’s too hot. Personally, I don’t think applying sunscreen has any effect, so I need to wear a hat. Wear sun protection clothing, otherwise you will be exposed to the same sun as Song Xiaobao. At night, we went to Zhongshan Road, which is quite a big commercial street. It was dazzling to see. Most of the specialty products were bought at Zengcuo’an, so I didn’t buy them here. What, I just ate seafood. The price is different in each store. I ate it in a small store. The Pipi shrimps cost 58 per pound. The price at another store was 88. There is a big difference. Go to a few more stores or you will be charged. Damn it, the meal for the two of us cost less than 300. <br>The staff at the Pan Pacific Hotel are very enthusiastic, especially the concierge. However, the cleanliness of the room cannot be complimented. When I opened the quilt, there were many yellow stains on the sheets. It was obvious that I felt uncomfortable at the time. I called the switchboard to complain. , I just asked the waiter to change the sheets, but there was no response afterward. This is five stars... Breakfast is okay.

We agreed to get a refund at the time, but why did we change our booking again, and we didn't have time to board the plane at all? Have you ever seen someone send you a text message telling you the departure time two hours in advance, and it's still early in the morning? At five o'clock, we quickly contacted Tongcheng's customer service. Every time we called, we had to press several numbers, and the person who answered the phone was not the same person every time. We had to explain all our experiences clearly. I will recount this day. No less than 20 times, and the customer service staff on the same trip called to tell them to start work at 7 a.m., but we kept calling until 8 o'clock before the customer service service was opened. We were in a hurry because the flight we purchased was about to board. , I finally contacted them before boarding the plane, and asked to verify whether the final verification result was changed by them. It was changed internally by Tianjin Airlines. They also asked us to contact the airline ourselves, so we quickly called Tianjin Airlines. , they also said that someone called them from a mobile phone number and asked them to change it. I said, can I change the flight at will if I didn’t call them in person? The final result of the negotiation between the two parties was that the money would be transferred to my card. I have been waiting for four or five days now. I still have no news. I called today and asked me to wait patiently. They said it would take 7 to 10 days, so I had no choice but to waited. I chose this group because the hotel is opposite Gulangyu Island, opposite the road is Heping Pier, and it is close to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. It takes about five minutes to walk. It is very convenient to go to Xiamen University, Baicheng Beach and Huandao Road. The result is not disappointing. The hotel service Very good. I felt a lot better after being in a bad mood. The hotel service is very attentive and every staff member is very enthusiastic. Moreover, the hotel pays special attention to safety issues. Every guest must enter their room number. Yes. You can only take the elevator with your identity information, and guests can only meet in the lobby on the first floor. This is very satisfactory. Even if you travel alone, you won't have anything to worry about. When I entered the room, I felt that the view was very good. It was a very comfortable sea view room. Every corner of the room was spotless. This was also the most satisfying part of our trip. The hotel's breakfast was very rich, including Chinese and Western food, and the restaurant environment was also good. . Finally, I would like to recommend some food to everyone. Huang Zehe’s peanut soup, sand tea noodles, and sea oyster pan-fried are all the best. Old shop) There are also a series of Nanputuo vegetarian cake pies, coconut cakes, Huang Zehe and others. There are so many shops selling delicious food. I can’t write them all in 1,000 words.",Neutral

The result was that because our flight was not canceled but just delayed, we could not refund the trip. The most we could do was refund the air ticket, which was only 1,000 yuan.

This is stated in the agreement. <br><br>Then, let’s start with traveling. I could choose my own flight, so I chose the connecting flight from Nanyuan Airport, which is close to my home. I have flown with China Airlines many times before, and I know how deceptive it is. Except for free boiled water, everything else is charged, so I brought my own. Water glass. I paid special attention to the text message reminders and various notifications sent on the same journey, all of which stated that you can bring your own luggage up to 20 kilograms. But the actual situation is: if the luggage must be checked, then a check-in fee will be charged, and the check-in fee starts at 60 yuan. If you order this fee from United Airlines' official website on the first day, you can get a discount of 15 or 30 yuan, depending on the flight distance. I hope that before the second airport is built, these joint airline precautions must be reminded to users, otherwise they will feel bad. <br><br>After arriving at Xiamen Airport, the pick-up call came immediately. There were thoughtful reminders before and after the flight, which made me feel very safe. Was the driver assigned by Cinda** too busy? He actually told me to look for a green van in the parking lot. I came out of Exit 9, crossed the road, walked to the parking lot, and walked around in a big circle, and there was actually a green van. There are no green cars. After communication, I found the driver, and he took me to the van in person. It turned out that it was a blue van that could not be bluer... Although I was speechless, the driver had a good attitude and kept apologizing, so I didn't I didn’t care about it.<br><br>After that, there was also a problem with the airport delivery. The night before the delivery, the team contact called me to confirm the time and location, but when the car was dispatched the next day, the driver actually went to the wrong place. At that time, I thought he had arrived at the hotel lobby door, and he also thought he had arrived at the hotel where I was picked up. Of course, both of us were confused. It rained moderately in Xiamen that day, the road conditions were bad, and the traffic jam was serious, so the team urgently called a car from China Rental Cars to pick up the car. However, the driver from China was not specifically explained to me. He thought it was me who called the car. At that time, the driver from China called me first. Of course I didn’t understand why he called me and why I was being served. Then a call came from the team, and the misunderstanding was explained. This back and forth delayed me by nearly 30 minutes. If the departure time hadn't been 2 and a half hours earlier than the departure time, I might have been in a hurry. <br><br>The above is all the unpleasant parts. Let’s talk about the good points:<br><br>Sheraton is very good, especially the gym makes me satisfied. Because I like fitness, I would like to describe this gym specifically. Open from 6am to 10pm. The facilities are very good. The treadmills and bicycles can all watch the TV channels of the hotel system, which means that you can watch HBO and the like that you usually can't see in the gym while running.

One hour okay? Finally, the flight was not delayed. Is it easy for those of us who take time off to travel? The service provided by Tongcheng is not good, really not good. When it came time to drop them off at the airport, we also had to pick up two other groups of people, both of whom were in different hotels. I didn’t let him drop them off and took a taxi myself, which cost more than 20 yuan.

When I went to the hotel at my destination, I was told what the concept was without a reservation! After spending half an hour at the front desk, the hotel staff felt very sorry. I called Tongcheng's customer service number and said it would be resolved immediately, and then I waited to contact my one-on-one consultant. The call was not answered.

3221,3221,"After placing the order, I confirmed with customer service that I would book two rooms, one with a king bed and one with a twin bed. I would pay only after confirming that it was OK. About a week later, I called Tongcheng and said they didn't have a double bed. I explained my reasons and hoped for coordination, because otherwise I wouldn't have made a decision at that time. They agreed to coordinate, but I didn't hear back from them since. On the day of the trip, I learned that there were still no double-bed rooms. A few hours before the trip, I was asked if I would like to stay at Indigo for two days. This was very strange. The price of hotel drinks at Indigo was lower than that at Westin, and the location was completely different. There are many five-star hotels with different grades. I am not saying that Indigo is not good, but it goes against my planned itinerary, and we have children and don’t want to change hotels. After some coordination, we said it was OK. We checked into the hotel around 5:30 pm that day and ran into the same problem again. We asked if we could change to two standard rooms. They said they were all full. Then we asked if we could accept a smoking room. I brought my baby over and asked me There is no common sense on this issue. Later, they said that our Westin was fully booked last night and the room had not been cleaned yet. It was almost six o'clock in the afternoon, and the hotel actually told me that the cleaning was not done well and that I could not enter the room. It said it would be ready around eight o'clock in the evening, and I was given a twin room first. After about an hour of fussing, I was finally given a double room, but it was pitiful compared to the twin room. It was probably the smallest room in a five-star hotel I've ever stayed in. I only had one suitcase with me. But nowhere is open. I seriously doubt this can be considered a deluxe room. I booked this hotel because of its location. My kids can walk to the Science and Technology Museum, but the process from booking to checking in was too much. On the last day, I asked if my check-out could be postponed, and the reply said that I had made a reservation and it was not possible. Later, after coordination, I was asked to postpone my check-out for one hour. However, I checked out the room early in the morning to save myself the trouble. <br>When I went there, I never got the phone number of the pick-up guy I was given. The guy won’t contact you, and he won’t reply if you contact him. On the return trip, I contacted the vehicle dispatch and said that I hoped to leave at 14:45 and that I would wait in the hotel lobby on time. As a result, the car didn't arrive by 15:10, so I immediately contacted the dispatcher. If it didn't arrive, I would take a taxi myself. As a result, the dispatcher urgently called Didi to the hotel to take us to the airport. Fortunately, the flight was not delayed. <br>Perhaps many of the links in the middle are not necessarily due to Tongcheng. I am relatively unsophisticated. I used to book my own air tickets and hotels. This is the first time I have used a travel platform to book. This is the first time I have used Tongcheng. I also participated with the encouragement of customer service. After visiting the Bailu Club, I thought I would have everything I needed to book a hotel, but it seems that’s not necessarily the case. Maybe this is the general level of service in Xiamen, maybe it’s not. Perhaps the communication and connection with Tongcheng needs to be improved.",Neutral

The phone call from the same journey said that the flight was cancelled, and asked us if we wanted the 20:30 flight. Isn’t this nonsense? If we didn’t want it, wouldn’t we come back? We have no choice but to ask for it, but when we talked to Tongcheng about the issue of adding money for air tickets, they ignored it and had a very bad attitude. They told us to complain if we wanted to. It had nothing to do with them and caused us trouble when picking up the plane. No one picked up, so I took a taxi back to Suzhou from Shanghai Airport.

The customer service is okay, but I don’t know what kind of bugs there are. The bites left red envelopes all over three of our legs, and they are still sore and itchy. I have never stayed at the Sheraton, but I don’t know that their breakfast charges children’s price of 86 yuan for those over 3 years old, which is a bit expensive. When I travel again, it may be summer vacation. Xiamen is full of people. Before I went to Xiamen University, I read online that it was open all day during summer vacation. When I arrived, there was a long queue around 10:30. When I asked, I was told that it would not be open until 12 o'clock. Okay, just wait. Well, along the way, local grandparents led groups of people to the front of the line one after another. Later I found out that they were paid to jump in line. There was a hole at the entrance that was opened at 12 o'clock. I don't know how it was opened. It was all People who jumped in line pushed and pushed forward, almost causing a stampede accident. There was no one to supervise the whole process. After finally entering the university gate, I was already in a bad mood. Thinking about it, it would be better to transfer to Suzhou University.

My impression was that it would be a city with blue sky and white clouds, cleanliness, polite people, and a fresh and artistic city. <br>Practice has proved that ideals are plump and reality is skinny. <br>Before traveling: I placed the order half a month in advance, and the customer service specifically called me to ask what room I wanted. Please note that I wanted a standard room, but the tour notice stated a king bed, and the customer service did not tell me. There were no standard rooms.

The only thing is that it is a bit far away. Going to any scenic spot requires at least 10 stops and requires transfers, and the 6th bus is super rare. If you can wait 20 minutes, it will be fast. <br>Transportation: I have been to all the famous scenic spots. Before I came, I saw everyone commenting that the transportation is very convenient. After I came, I felt that I might have come to a fake Xiamen. There were repairs everywhere, and the bus stops and instructions were very messy. The cards are extremely hard to find! Drivers use their lives to drive, and if they are particularly violent, they will hit someone wherever they happen to be. What particularly shocked me was the quality of the people in Xiamen. 8 out of 10 small yellow cars had their serial numbers torn off. Privatization was particularly serious! The whole city is under construction and it is not convenient at all. The roads are jammed and the cars are bumpy and crowded! <br>The whole Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street is being repaired. Oh, no, the whole of Xiamen is being repaired. The city is dilapidated and shabby. This may be nostalgia in the eyes of literary and artistic young people. Forgive my ignorance. Such literary and artistic me I really can't see it, I can only see the mess! <br>Gulangyu Island: From the moment I landed on the island, someone every five meters asked if I wanted tickets to the wax museum, if I wanted a tour guide, if I wanted to eat this or that. It’s really super annoying and brings down your goodwill from the start. Every store on Longtou Road is chasing after you to solicit customers, and the experience is very poor. Except for the buildings and the beach, there are no other highlights. <br>Food: There are indeed many snacks in Xiamen, but not many can be called gourmet. Dianping's five-star food is advertised everywhere, and it is said to be the most authentic in old Xiamen. Everyone should prepare a strategy in advance and don't listen to the bullshit on the street. <br>If I want to give a guide before this time, I saw someone say ""Xiamen, a city that you don't want to leave when you come here.""

It is a five-star hotel. There may be a BRIC meeting recently, so the security is very strict. The room is relatively okay, especially the bathroom is quite big. One day after checking in, I called the front desk to deliver something. I called the front desk at least 4 times and it took nearly an hour to deliver it. We went out the next morning. Logically speaking, the hotel should arrange for room cleaning until we come back at around 1 p.m. The room was still not cleaned at that time. I called the front desk to ask them to clean it. After waiting for 40 minutes, there was still no one. Because my children had to take a lunch break, I called them again and asked them not to come to clean it yet. When we left in the afternoon, we would notify them to arrange cleaning. I have made it very clear. About an hour later, the whole family was sleeping and there was no knocking. The door suddenly opened. My daughter and I were frightened. I stopped her immediately and did not come in. The front desk manager later told us You apologized and said that you would give us a fruit plate, but when we went back in the evening, there was nothing. It was not that you asked for the fruit plate from your hotel, but that you had said that this was done. Is this the so-called five-star service? Let’s talk about the hotel on Gulangyu Island. We stayed at the four-star Sea Garden Hotel. We arrived at the hotel after 12 o’clock and checked in by ourselves. We were told that check-in could only be done after 3 pm. I asked about check-out. It was time to check out. She said that before 12 o'clock, I negotiated with her whether other guests could give me priority to arrange cleaning after they checked out. At first, she replied that there was nothing I could do. There was only one waiter on the first floor. It was too late, so I negotiated again. I had a child with me, and the temperature that day was very high. I had been out and about all morning, so I wanted to check in early and take the child to have a rest. It would take 40 minutes at the fastest to get back to me. I said that was fine, and I would check in in 40 minutes. She said she couldn't be sure, and the answer she would always give you is not sure. Later, after negotiation with the hotel, Tongcheng said that we would be given a room belonging to someone else. I didn't understand. If a room was not available, someone else's room would be given to us first. If you give me away, it means that someone else gave you double the money?

After leaving the airport, we took a taxi directly to the Sheraton Hotel in Jiangtou. The hotel's service and catering are good, and it also has a fitness center. However, it is far away from Xiamen's classic restaurants, so you have to take a taxi back and forth. The next day we went to Xiamen University, Baicheng Beach, and Zengcuo'an. You can rent an electric car or bicycle to ride along Baicheng Beach. It is not recommended to eat seafood along the coastline, as it will rip off customers. But every once in a while there will be vendors selling mangoes on electric bicycles or three-wheeled trucks. The prices are relatively reasonable, and if you buy a certain quantity, you can get free shipping nationwide. Zengcuo'an has a variety of snacks and the seafood is not expensive, so many tourists take a taxi and go straight to here after getting off the plane. They can also stay in B&Bs here. Because we ran a lot, we set off back to the hotel at around three o'clock. That night I took a taxi to the Lotus Park Fried Crab Main Store. This is a store that only locals know about and it tastes great. On the afternoon of the third day, we took a boat to Gulangyu Island from Xiagu Pier. It was a little far from Sanqiutian Pier to the Pannuo Hotel we had booked. The only means of transportation on the island is battery carts, but there are quite a few people dragging their luggage. After all, the island is not big. There are many seafood food stalls on the island, but the Didi Express driver warned us several times that we must not eat seafood on the island, as we will be ripped off!

If you want to eat authentic and inexpensive seafood, we recommend Kaiyuan 141 and Xiaoyan Food Stall near Zhongshan Road.

Since my companion had already placed a booking and needed to go together, I had no choice but to book it like this, but I felt very uncomfortable! I arrived at 4 pm on the first day and went to eat seafood after a break. Since the hotel was far away from the city, I found a seafood restaurant nearby. The taste was not good and it was quite expensive. It was the most embarrassing meal in Xiamen. , it is recommended to live closer to the city, there are many choices, and it is not expensive. The next day, we took a taxi to Xiamen University, then Furong Tunnel, and then to Baicheng Beach. The children had a great time and rented an electric bicycle. Cycling on Huandao Road is very comfortable, and the scenery along the way is beautiful. You have to go to Zengcuo'an. It's very cheap to go shopping and eat there. 10 oysters are 10 yuan, and 7 skewers of squid are 10 yuan. They are all at the same price, so just bring them. The kids may be tired, so we took a taxi back to the hotel to rest. After having a seafood dinner in the evening, swimming, fitness, and steaming in the hotel are still good choices.

The old restaurant will not rip off customers and the taste is great. It is recommended to book ferry tickets a few days in advance. We only booked tickets for 3pm a day in advance. Be sure to Booking tickets for the ferry at Neicuo'ao Pier, we didn't know that the boat got off at Sanqiutian Pier, which is quite far from the hotel. There are no taxis on the island, only electric cars, which cost 50 yuan per person. We chose to walk and stayed at the hotel. It's very comfortable to stroll along the seaside. There are various small shops in the evening, which are very unique. I had a fish spa and all kinds of small shops!

Why did I wait until nearly 2 hours later when I got angry before giving it to me? This is for online ordering and payment. Is there any differential treatment of cash?

There is a swimming pool on the 7th floor, which the children like very much. On the third day when I arrived at Gulangyu Island, the business rooms in the Pannuo Hotel were not as good as those in the Hanting Hotel. The 7-day chain hotel was small and shabby.

On Gulangyu Island The hotel is also very good, very close to Neicuoao Pier. The mosquitoes in Xiamen are so powerful that almost all of my legs were bitten. It is recommended to wear a mosquito repellent such as a mosquito repellent bracelet. I originally heard from a friend that the taste there is relatively bland, and suggested that I bring a bottle of Lao Gan Ma there, but I personally feel that the taste is okay and there is no need to bring Lao Gan Ma.",Neutral

The flight was delayed twice when I went there, but it went smoothly when I came back. Sheraton is a good accommodation. I like everything. However, the location of the hotel is not very good. Apart from the SM Commercial Plaza, the roads nearby are quite congested. The hotel in Gulangyu Island is very average and not very quiet. Although it is very close to the pier and only takes two minutes, it is relatively far from the places to eat. The Sheraton is not in a good location, and it is relatively far away from the major attractions. The nearest person to take a taxi is in his early thirties, let alone Zengcuo'an.

I then added money to change the room, and then contacted the customer service to cancel. The payment was very fast, but the itinerary for the last night of the whole trip was unreasonable, because we had to cross the ferry, and the flight was at 8 o'clock in the morning, and we had to get up at about 5 o'clock.

Because the two of us had babies with tickets issued by the airline, we were told that each person had to pay 50 to get the airport transfer, but it was actually a five-seater. Private car transfer, because I didn’t know beforehand, so I ordered my own car to pick up and drop off, which cost about 150 for a round trip. <br>3 The quality of the boating staff on Gulangyu Island is not generally bad. When they saw me holding my child, they asked someone to lift the suitcase during the security check.

Of course, the Sheraton Hotel is very good, but it is far away from attractions and so on. It is not recommended to choose it. The cost of taking a taxi every day is also a very considerable amount. Among the hotels on Gulangyu Island, the room arranged for us was only the cheapest in this hotel. The room was really small and pitiful. It’s not an exaggeration to say that my friend and I didn’t even have room to put our suitcases. It’s really not an exaggeration. Moreover, the only means of transportation on Gulangyu Island is Route 11, which relies entirely on walking on two legs. I spent money to become a member on Tongcheng and chose to travel twice on Tongcheng. To be honest, I was not very satisfied. There is still room for improvement. The staff at Tongcheng did not recommend the most suitable route for me based on my needs. It was like this on both trips, and I was disappointed.",Neutral
3303,3303,"It was great to stay at the Sheraton and Sea Garden Hotel, especially the breakfast was very rich, with a wide variety of Chinese and Western food. What I was unhappy with was that the default flight on the webpage was China Eastern Airlines mu2892, and the flight back was Shandong Airlines' flight at around 7:00 in the morning. Since the default itinerary was to stay in Gulangyu Island for the third night, there was no way I could catch that flight. Before submitting the order, I carefully reselected the flight, but after the payment was completed, it was still the default flight. I immediately communicated with customer service, and the customer service said that the ticket had been issued. In desperation, I had no choice but to cancel the return flight and buy 4 more tickets. The return ticket costs 342 yuan per ticket, a total loss of more than 1,000 yuan, which is very unpleasant! The flight there was scheduled to take off at 19:45, but it was delayed until 23:10. It was past 2 o'clock at night to go through the check-in procedures at the Sheraton.

It is not recommended to find a local tour guide after arriving at Gulangyu Island to take you to sightseeing spots or whatever for 20 yuan or 60 yuan! Not recommended! You have to do a good job in the free travel strategy, but even if you do it well, you are still a bit road-crazy, hahahaha! Overall, it’s average! Although the Sheraton in Xiamen is a five-star hotel, to be honest, the rooms are really old. Even the TVs for watching programs are of ordinary quality and the remote control is broken! This kind of five-star hotel is not as good as an ordinary express hotel. At least there are about 100 other TV stations! Anyway, I won’t come here a second time!",Neutral

For more than two hours, the overall experience did not achieve the purpose of tourism, nor did it have a comprehensive tour of Xiamen. Since the self-guided tour on the same journey did not purchase cancellation insurance, no changes or refunds will be given, and the total amount will basically be lost.

I relied on the hotel's help and took a taxi to carry my luggage, so I finally didn't miss my flight. However, it is unexpected that the private cars in Xiamen are so different from those in Shanghai, and the charges are not cheap. I hope Tongcheng will pay attention to coordination in the future. Other aspects are the accommodation on Gulangyu Island. Although I was prepared for an ordinary B&B, it was my first time here, and now the society is mixed.

I took a taxi from the airport to this hotel (there is a picture to prove it). I came here for three days and arranged it like this.

Later, I contacted Dandan, the local tour guide in Xiamen. , she immediately helped me deal with it and communicated with the hotel. After waiting for about 10 minutes, I swiped my ID card and my information came out. After finally going upstairs, I couldn't swipe my card and the door couldn't be opened. I ran to the front desk for consultation. Later, they gave me a new card and I was finally able to enter the room. My summary of Times Yaju Hotel is: The picture and text do not match. Don't believe the pictures on the Internet. The facilities in the room are very old-fashioned and shabby. It's hard to get used to it, and I stayed there for two nights. Later, I stayed at the Yuejing Yazhu Family Hotel on Gulangyu Island for one night. The conditions were not good, the room was small, and the distance was very long. It took me a long time to get there without taking the wrong route. The return flight was supposed to be at 16.25 on the 25th. At noon that day, they called me and told me that our flight was canceled and rescheduled to 21.55 in the evening. It was like a bolt from the blue. We were eating at the time and lost our appetite in an instant. Since we were on the night of the 24th, We booked a chartered car to be delivered from Shanghai Airport to our home. Then I had no choice but to cancel the chartered car order. Okay, at 21.55 it still didn’t fly, so I waited for another 2 hours in the waiting room, finally went through security check, got on the plane, and waited for another 1 hour on the plane before taking off.

The room on the first floor had no windows and was very small. The Gulangyu Villa Hotel was very good on the second night👌👍.

I did my own calculations and found that booking air tickets and hotels by myself is cheaper than traveling on the same journey. I feel like I’m at a loss. For your reference.

He wrote very detailed information and sent it to me every day. When I could not find a place to eat, The tour guide Xiaomao always sent me maps and locations of places and places to stay. He was really nice. In Wuyi Mountain, I had to catch a flight in advance and Xiao Liao sent me off in advance. The arrangements were in place. There were many elderly people in our group. , both tour guides take great care of the elderly. Here, I am very grateful to the three tour guides and the military tour guide. Thank you for your hard work.",Neutral

3339,3339,"It has been 4 or 5 days since my trip to Xiamen, and I have been struggling with whether to write a review and how to write it. There is no need to go into details about Xiamen’s scenic spots and natural scenery here. The main purpose here is to evaluate the service. I will write something after reading the reviews of many friends and combining it with my own personal experience. First of all, everything has its pros and cons. Let’s first summarize the admirable features of this line: 1. There are reminders before each trip, whether it is a text message before boarding or a pick-up call every day during the trip. The tour guide's ** is very good. 2. The pick-up and drop-off time was very punctual. I received a call as soon as I got off the plane. When I walked to the exit, there were already people waiting. I got in the car and drove directly to the hotel. On the way back, the airport drop-off driver had to pick up guests from several hotels along the way. The time I agreed on the day before was almost exactly the same! great! 3. The arranged Meiyuan Hotel is very good, with an excellent location. There is a BRT bus station across the overpass in front of the door. It costs one yuan per person to take the bus to Zhongshan Road. The hotel is located in a prosperous business district. Supermarkets, restaurants and snacks are very convenient, and the breakfast variety is rich. Also to my taste, the room service attitude is also enthusiastic. A small detail, the shampoo and shower gel is actually a large bottle of Lux, wow... 4. The itinerary is rich in content, including basically all the famous scenic spots in and around Xiamen. The overall feeling is that I have been shopping every day, well, I am still a little tired. ... ...Okay, let me make some complaints next: 1. The time to visit various attractions is relatively tight, and I always feel that it is not enough. The one-way drive to Tulou takes three hours, and there is a shopping spot in the middle. After arriving at the lunch place, you have to sit down and taste tea. After changing to Tulou to pick up the tour guide, you were also taken to a shop that is said to be your own shop to taste tea. It takes a long time. . Because lunch at Xiamen University was arranged in the itinerary, Xiamen University ended at 14:10. Then we drove to the drop-off point on Huandao Road. I was told that after playing with Zeng Cuo'an, we had to meet at 16:10. That was more than an hour. How to play? It turned out that after the gathering, the car went directly to a relatively remote shopping mall for shopping, so... I had no choice but to take a taxi with my children to the Hulishan Fortress the next morning. 2. Some attractions seem to be filled with reservations, and the time arrangement is very unreasonable. The Railway Cultural Park is purely a morning exercise place for citizens. Most of the travelers on the train returned after walking two to three hundred meters, so there was nothing to see. Then I stayed in Nanputuo Temple for nearly 2 hours! It was a cool and windy day, and there was no shelter from the wind. It was simply torture. ...Although it is a group tour and cannot be compared with the in-depth travel of independent travel, I still hope that more attention can be paid to the details.",Neutral
3340,3340,"When I chose to travel during the Spring Festival, I originally wanted to avoid the hustle and bustle of the city. When I saw that Tongcheng was self-operated, I thought it would be a guaranteed itinerary before joining... But, thousands of miles away, I rushed around the island in a hurry for 8 hours - there was no time to appreciate the scenery of Gulangyu Island; Terrible catering - try to fill yourself up with plain porridge for breakfast, and take care of lunch and dinner by yourself (the key is you have to find a place to eat dinner); crowded buses, taxi drivers who increase prices at will..., the best thing is actually the Lu that changed the project The Jiang night tour was cancelled, but we didn’t know until we arrived at the pier on the 30th night and saw a big lock... The family spent more than an hour at the pier along the river in a strange city in the cold wind before they got a taxi with an increased price. Their spirits were waning. I slept in the hotel...<br>It is still possible to travel independently, adjust the rhythm and arrange the time, Xiamen University, Nanputuo, Hulishan Fort, China Town (similar to Wuhan Pedestrian Street)...<br>The city of Xiamen The environment is very comfortable. Uninterrupted spraying of water mist is more effective in reducing suspended pollutants in the air than uninterrupted watering. It is worth learning! Moreover, no-food buses can effectively remind the public to jointly supervise the bad habit of eating on buses and give everyone a fresh breathing space! <br>Thanks to the ""high-speed"" tour guide Xia Lianying for taking up your Spring Festival reunion time to help coordinate and deal with the problem of scheduling negligence. Although it was not solved, I believe you tried your best, so no matter what the result, I can only accept it.

There is nothing interesting in Xiamen. They are all snacks that my parents don’t like very much. The pictures of snacks are very different from the actual ones, which is a bit disappointing. , you will get hot when you go out in summer, remember to be prepared for sun protection. The accommodation in Xiamen has convenient transportation, but the environment is not very good. The villa on Gulangyu Island is very nice, and it is opposite the beach. It is recommended to stay for one night, and then go to Gulangyu Island. Eat snacks at the snack street. The night view of Gulangyu Island is still very beautiful. You can play in the sea and beach🏖. It’s a good choice. I didn’t go to Xiamen University because there were too many people.",Neutral
3343,3343,"To be honest, I really want to leave a negative review, because this is the most disappointing time I have ever used Tongcheng Travel! First, I originally planned to stay in the castle series. If the castle room was full and reservations were not allowed, I ended up staying at the Xige Hotel in the city. The room was extremely small, but it was relatively clean and comfortable. What made me angry was that when we arrived at the hotel after 10 o'clock on the first night, we were told that there was no reservation for us. Fortunately, the hotel was not fully booked and we had to make an emergency call to arrange accommodation. The second worst thing is that the trip to Gulangyu Island on the third day was like going to the market. Even to take pictures, I had to run all the way to chase the tour guide. It was better to go to the island and watch it slowly. The tour guides were very kind and amiable. I upgraded to stay on the island at night. ""Grandma's Penghu Bay"" warns everyone, if you have any requirements for a bed, please give it up! That mattress was like sleeping directly on the springs, which was unbearable. I had to turn on the air conditioner to 30 degrees and sleep on the quilt with my clothes on! The third worst thing is that the Furong Restaurant in Xiamen University is a rip-off, it’s expensive and tastes bad. I recommend Zengcuo’an for authentic Xiamen snacks. I think Xiamen University is not as beautiful as the legend says, so I wasted my time on Xiamen University the next day. and Nanputuo Temple, so I didn’t have time to go to Yongding Tulou and Yunshui Yao on the last day. I recommend that you put your trip to Xiamen University on your last itinerary. Finally, thank you to Tongcheng for sending Pien Tze Huang’s facial mask and Gulangyu Monet coffee. Monet’s garden is really beautiful!",Neutral
3344,3344,"There are four people traveling, two mothers and two children. The first two nights I stayed at Tangdale Hotel, the facilities were outdated, and the breakfast was very poor; the third night I stayed at Gulangyu Island, for a three-star hotel, the facilities were complete, clean and tidy, the service was in place, and the breakfast was rich; the fourth and fifth nights were in Wuyi Mountain I checked into a strange hotel. Although the name of the hotel was quite poetic, I didn’t remember it. I only remember clearly that there were huge cockroaches! ! ! To say it's an inch bigger is an understatement. I asked to change rooms, but the front desk said this was unavoidable! ! ! After several twists and turns, I changed rooms, and Xiaoqiang came back to another room at night. It was really torture. <br>I originally wanted to refund the ticket and change it, but because it was already off-duty when I called the customer service, no one paid attention. (Didn’t I promise 24-hour service?)<br>Xiamen snacks are pretty good and worth tasting. Seafood is quite expensive! During the past few days we were there, there were excavations everywhere in preparation for the BRICS meeting, so the city looked a bit messy and the sea water was a bit dirty. <br>The journey to Yunshuiyao is a bit far, and it is surrounded by mountain roads. It is recommended that friends who suffer from motion sickness prepare in advance. The scenery is beautiful. I don’t know much about buildings like earth buildings, but I was surprised by the ancients’ emphasis on practicality, Feng Shui, structure, etc. of buildings. amazing! <br>You can go shopping at Gulangyu Snack Street. I didn’t go to Sunlight Rock because it was too hot.

3369,3369,"Overall it's average. Many scenic spots are just a quick tour. On the first day of Yunshuiyao, the advertisement placement of the tour guide caught people off guard, but fortunately, it didn’t feel very annoying. The next Tulou tour guide was disgusting. She was a local, so of course she was very familiar with those places. For us, everywhere felt very new, and we wanted to take more photos, but the time given to us was very short, and we basically kept walking. We thought it was a long distance and we had to hurry up. Who knew that they would eventually take us to their home? They said it was free tea, but I really thought it was because of the enthusiasm of the people. To put it bluntly, they were selling things, and almost every house there bought something. No wonder I ran all the way because I wanted to stay at her house for a while. Of course, you don’t have to buy it if you are thick-skinned, but everyone at our table was thin-skinned. Gulangyu Island was okay the next day. We were pressed for time and there were many places to visit. On the third day, one of the attractions was said to be closed and moved to the Railway Park. It was an ordinary park, with nothing to see and a place for people to do morning exercises. Xiamen University basically only has lunch time, and there is basically no time to transfer (in order to enter Xiamen University, we queued for more than an hour). You set up this attraction just to top up your time. We went to Huandao Road in the afternoon, and they gathered us at 15:30 and headed back. I remember the contract said it was around 17:00. It’s just a quick look at the flowers. The most depressing thing is that the flight back and forth was delayed by 3 hours and 57 minutes when I left. The flight was canceled when I came back. After the flight was changed, it was delayed by more than 4 hours. This means that I basically spent a whole day at the airport on the day I came back, contacting customer service. , the customer service staff of the complaint department had a very cold attitude. Everyone was depressed when this happened. She didn’t even think about asking you to pay compensation on the same trip. She didn’t even say a word of comfort. She said coldly that it didn’t matter if we were on the same trip. The compensation is what you pay, and if the insurance doesn’t pay, you don’t have anything (you bought the insurance). I was so angry that I really wanted to curse. I was already in a bad mood, but I encountered such a cold customer service! As for the scenic spots, it should be much better if you pay a little more instead of just looking at them.",Neutral
3370,3370,"In March, Xiamen has warm spring flowers and a slight chill in the morning and evening. I stayed at the Yijing Hotel without heating and air conditioning, and it was rainy. The next day, I waited for 50 minutes at the station in a sunny and drafty place (the bus to Yunshuiyao was half an hour late). Fortunately, I took the food in time and got the allergy under control. On the third day, I changed to the quasi-four-star Jinjiu Hotel, which had an air conditioner, but I found that the smell of sewage in the bathroom was very bad and I couldn't use the toilet to take a shower. The other facilities of the two hotels are quite satisfactory and they all arrange rooms with windows. I would like to remind those who are going to Xiamen to pay attention to avoid similar situations. Our director Lai Caiying is quite good. In addition to leading the team and explaining the scenic spots, he helps the elderly get on and off the bus; introduces the best scenic spots; takes the initiative to take photos for tourists; along the way, he takes the initiative to understand the needs of each group of tourists and can find ways to meet them.

He said it was brought by his friend from Taiwan. At first, he said he didn't have it and sold it, so he called me later. He said that his friend still had some and asked his friend to send them back, and many people bought them on the bus. Unexpectedly, when I went to Gulangyu Island the next day, I saw a few tour guides on the boat with a bottle hanging on their bags. I instantly felt like I had been cheated. In Tulou They make you drink tea before eating, and then take you to the tour guide’s house for tea in the afternoon (actually, it feels like it’s not the tour guide’s house but the tea seller). It’s quite annoying. I’ll just go on my own when traveling in the future! Attached is a photo of another tour guide’s bag hanging with ammonia sugar that I saw on the boat.

By the way, I returned to Gulangyu Island to enjoy the romantic atmosphere there again. We drove there in the morning and received a call from Xiamen customer service on the same day: 0592513663 Ms. Li called and enthusiastically suggested that we change the Yunshuiyao Tulou Tour on the second day and the Xiamen Island Tour on the third day and told us that it would be a small group of 14 people so that the service would be more attentive, so we agreed, and the result That night, our tour guide Xia Lianying called us and asked us to wait in front of the hotel at 9 o'clock the next morning. Then we followed the itinerary and walked to Egret Park → Nan Putuo Temple. We asked Xia Da if we had not gone yet? They were from Xiada University, and then they asked us to go eat by ourselves. When I said that meals were included in the itinerary, she kept saying that we would take care of ourselves. Then we took out the itinerary downloaded on our mobile phones and asked her to consult the company. They showed her the itinerary and she called. The phone company finally had this free lunch. After the meal, we went to Zengcuo'an and let us go and have fun on our own. They told us to meet at a time and it was ok. Then they gathered us in the car and told us to take us back. There was no explanation along the way. , I asked how many points around the island we still haven’t gone to? I asked if we haven’t gone to the Golden Diamond Conference yet? She was stunned for a moment and said it was too far there, and we couldn’t go there today. Then we insisted on asking her to ask the driver to take us there, but the result was still the same. We were sent back to the hotel. I looked at my phone and it was only 3pm. We were very dissatisfied when we heard that she and the driver were too late to pick up other guests at Didu time! We warned her on the spot that we would go back and file a complaint. Before she left, she said, ""I'm not afraid if you go and file a complaint."" When we returned to the hotel, we immediately contacted Tongcheng's customer service and explained the above situation to Xiamen's customer service Xiao Li. Xiao Li replied that Director Xia had not fulfilled her responsibilities and the company had ordered her to be laid off and retrained. They discussed the compensation plan with me. In the end, we had to give up the time for free travel on Gulangyu Island before we were sent to the station and travel around the island again, which affected our self-guided tour plan on Gulangyu Island. In short, we set off at 9 am and returned to the hotel at 3 pm. The day’s trip is over! This is a true reflection of the personal experience of our eight fellow travelers. We want to attract your attention! And give us a notarized reply. This is one of them. Second, we upgraded to the Gulangyu Hotel for an additional 68 yuan on the last night. We had previously consulted customer service and the answer was that it was a specialty hotel of the same level. But when we went there, we found out that my grandma’s Penghu Bay is not a hotel but a hotel. The location is very good and is near Yuyuan Garden. Also, I originally planned to go to Haitianggou at my own expense the next morning. The hygienic condition of the room facilities is very poor. There are only two beds and a small chair. We went to Gulangyu Island on the fourth day. There is no car to pick up and there is almost no service. It is a long way to the hotel, and it is uphill to reach the hotel and there is still a long way to go. We were dragging our heavy luggage along a long slope and many steps. One of them had a foot injury and had a disability certificate. No one helped us! That day, Director Mao led the group, and we dragged our luggage for a long distance while listening to the explanation. After walking for an hour, my clothes were all wet, and it was obviously very strenuous. I finally arrived at the hotel and stored my luggage before continuing the tour.

It is true that China’s civil aviation is notorious for its long-term reputation. Tulou is just like that. Gulangyu Island is beautiful but there are too many people and it is too commercialized.

I had to go back and forth to the front desk on the 8th floor several times. Just opened the door for us. It happened again in the afternoon and again in the evening. The front desk said that the system was broken and the door could not be opened. Then why every time we came back to the front desk and asked them to come up and open the door for us, the front desk asked us to go up and try to see if it was ok, and if not, come back down and find them. Sure enough, I have to make several trips every time! The worst thing is at night, it's too noisy, the noise from the roadside is very loud, and the room is not soundproofed at all. Can't sleep. When I asked the front desk to change rooms, the front desk said that their rooms were all on the roadside and there was nothing they could do about it. I didn't sleep all night, and I didn't have the energy to play in the morning. <br>The only good thing about this trip is that the tour guide was very good. He told her about the hotel situation and changed our hotel in time for the next day. More attentive. Full marks to the tour guide.",Neutral
3386,3386,"It was the first time I signed up for a trip on the same trip. Due to flight delays and cancellations, I arrived one day late. As a result, I lost one night of accommodation and one less day of free travel in the entire trip, but the cost was non-refundable. Well, even if I didn’t understand it clearly at the beginning, if you just back off a little bit, maybe I won’t say anything. If I go to Xiamen for the second time, I will choose to travel independently. The product I chose this time was 5 nights and 6 days. One day in the semester was for free travel (it was included in the original itinerary, but the departure flight was canceled and I arrived one day late, so my free travel was cancelled). The other days were with a group. In fact, It is a group tour, the group members are not fixed every day, and the tour guide changes every day. Because we were on a group tour, we walked past many scenic spots and showed them around. We just took photos when we arrived and left immediately. In fact, Xiamen is not a big city and it is very convenient to take the bus. Many attractions do not require tickets, so if you travel independently, you will gain more and discover more. However, Yunshuiyao Tulou Tour still feels like you need to go with a group because it’s quite far away, but you have to choose carefully if you go with a group. Anyway, we did a one-day tour of Tulou. We didn’t have much time for the whole itinerary. There were a lot of sales and shopping in the middle, so it took a lot of money. I went there for a long time and the group meal at noon was terrible, poor hygiene and depressing.",Neutral

You can basically take care of your own meals, but the toilet and bathroom of the Tangdale Hotel where you stay share the same door, which is a bit inconvenient. As for the customer service, the phone customer service is okay. Don’t ask for the online customer service. After I said it for a long time, she kept asking me what I meant. Oh, I’ll go. I can’t accept it. I changed my ticket for the return trip and told the customer service to modify it.

There were actually 45 tourists in a 40-passenger car. It took a long time to coordinate. This was the first day, but this happened again on the second day. The tour guide had to end the trip early on the last day because the bus was going to do other things, which was wrong. Hope to improve.",Neutral

He could contact and communicate in time. Zhangshou’s service was warm and thoughtful, but I felt that it was not comfortable to live in Wuyishan. Well, it’s not hygienic. The hotel in Wuyishan Daguo Tea Town is not big, and there are few breakfast varieties. What’s even more terrifying is that the steamed buns and cakes are served by hand without using tongs. Have you ever seen it? And the surrounding environment of the hotel is not good either. Alas, that Daguo Tea in Wuyishan The hotel is really not good. I had egg shells and steamed chicken excrement in the morning. You, a big company like Tongcheng.com, should ask this question. I didn’t want to take any pictures, so I didn’t take pictures.

First of all, when I first inquired, I said someone would call me back, but I waited for several days and no one called me. Just call again. The second time I called, the staff responded quickly. I briefly outlined my requirements and asked for a better hotel. The staff recommended this group. Out of trust, it’s decided. More than 6,800. Let’s talk about the plane first. The Spring and Autumn flight had no meals and was delayed for a long time. Still in Terminal 1, there was no way to buy anything to eat. Talking about hotels, Bonhams Pullman is really not good. I wanted a higher floor with a better view, but I was given a room on the sixth floor. My friend who was traveling with me was on the 8th floor, and the view was needless to say. The service is still very poor, and the self-service on the first floor is even less flattering. On the first day, the round trip to Yunshuiyao took 7 hours. My daughter and I didn’t even have lunch, as we really couldn’t compete with others. The next day, there were all kinds of queues at Gulangyu Island at Nanputuo Temple of Xiamen University, so there was no time to play. Not even a quick glance. After two days, we decided to go free on the last day. (Refunded by 280 in the same city) After playing sailing, the baby was very happy. The evening jeep night tour was the highlight of the trip.

However, the freshly cooked seafood was really delicious, which made up for the shortcomings. The process described in the process is to make bait and then go out on a sailboat to pull out the cage and watch the seafood you catch. The actual experience is not like this. There is no part of making bait. Going out on a sailboat is not the same place as fishing for crabs. We just catch crabs and cook them before eating them. After lunch, we took a car to another dock to queue up for a sailboat, which was a bit different from the itinerary. Gulangyu Island is very big. I went there on the Chinese Valentine's Day. It was the hottest day and I sweated a lot. It was a bit overwhelming. I suggest you go on a free trip to Gulangyu Island and book a boat ticket for the afternoon. When you arrive, the sun is weak and you can go play in the sea first. Play in the sand, stay on the island overnight, and visit the island the next day. This way, you won’t be rushed and return to Xiamen in the evening. The Egret Park on the last day is actually not interesting at all, so you don’t need to go there. Zengcuo'an is actually similar to the snack street on Gulangyu Island. There is not much difference. If you have a good time on Gulangyu Island, there is no need to go to Zengcuo'an again. I would like to give special praise to the tour guide Xiaoxia. She is very enthusiastic and attentive. She is very loving when she guides several children along the way and helps everyone with many extra things. She is a girl who can endure hardships very much. If you have the chance to come to Xiamen again, you should carefully visit Gulangyu Island. Other places are less important. Finally, I would like to criticize the accommodation. I arranged the Yijin Hotel. After seeing the low rating, I offered to change. However, the contact person said that it was full and did not agree to change.

Regarding accommodation (Gong Palace No. 1), it is the only bad thing in the entire trip One of the satisfying aspects is that first of all, the distance to the main road is very long and inconvenient. It takes nearly 10 minutes to walk through the winding village roads. I got lost many times. When I called the hotel front desk for help, I only received evasive answers because there were currently guests. In the end, every time Each time, I asked the kind-hearted residents living in the village to show me the way back. It was particularly inconvenient to set off every morning. I had to walk to the main road to locate a taxi, and the driver basically could not drive into the small roads; in addition, the rooms were cleaned every day. It took three reminders and four requests to complete it. The bath towels that were replaced after the first cleaning were all damp and stained, and they could not be used with confidence. After taking them all downstairs and fiddling with them, they were finally replaced. Anyway, we stayed for 4 nights. I was exhausted both mentally and physically, and I didn’t have a good night’s sleep; 4. There were no problems with the local customer service for the first few days, but on the last day of my return trip, the special car arrangement for the airport drop-off was either at the wrong destination or the driver was changed back and forth, and it was not very good after I made the request. In the end, it was because I was worried that the driver who would take me to the airport contacted me again and again to confirm. I was quite disappointed on the last day.",Neutral

I am very satisfied with the local customer service. They have been helping from front to back. There is a pick-up staff at the airport after arriving in Xiamen. We have already waited. The hotel in Xiamen is right on the pedestrian street. It is very convenient to go out. There are snacks everywhere. The hotel is a four-star standard. The hotel in Gulangyu is about a five-minute walk from Neicuoao Pier. I saw someone commenting that there is a car to pick up and drop off. We I didn't enjoy it. I asked the hotel staff and they said no. They added 480 per night and upgraded the sea view room. It was not much different from the ordinary room. The sea view in front was blocked by the view. I was not satisfied with this. The breakfast was average. The scary thing is that I was woken up by the barking of a group of wild cats at two o'clock in the middle of the night. The barking lasted for more than an hour, but the hotel did not take any measures. Regarding travel, I feel that Gulangyu is really a literary and fresh place. Great place, I will go there again next time!",Neutral
3443,3443,"We chose to travel independently in Xiamen this time, with a group of six people. The itinerary mentioned that there would be a pick-up at Xiamen Airport, so we made 6 or 7 phone calls and waited for nearly half an hour. Didi arranged a taxi for us to pick us up from the hotel. The hotel is quite good, clean and tidy, and it is right on Zhongshan Road. It is very convenient to travel. After playing for nearly three days, I took the boat to Gulangyu Island at 16:10 in the afternoon and stayed one night. The hotel is very close to the pier, 2 or 3 minutes We arrived in the middle of the day and were ready to check in. We had booked three rooms, but the front desk said that ** had booked us two rooms. After I showed them my itinerary, they asked me to wait and kept calling. After contacting us, we were given three rooms. Two of them were in line with the itinerary, but one of the rooms was very small, obviously inconsistent with what was booked, and was not in the same building. I felt that ** had obviously lowered the standard, and When I communicated with the front desk, they said that it had nothing to do with them and that the matter had to be reported to ** because one of my companions was feeling unwell and had to buy medicine, so they did not continue the communication and just stayed there first. However, I felt that there was something wrong with **'s arrangements. of. It was more fun to visit the island on the fourth day. This was also the last day. At 3pm, we took the boat to the pier and went to the airport to fly home. Overall it was good, the only thing was that the hotel on the island was a bit unpleasant.",Neutral

Then more than an hour later, I received a text message saying that the flight was cancelled. I was really confused. I booked a three-day stay because it was inconvenient to bring a child alone. I had been booking for a while, so I didn’t come here until I was about to leave. I then contacted the hotel here. , while thinking about the means of the outbound journey, I finally decided to take the train, and I had to book the ticket myself. I'm really speechless. Although the pick-up and drop-off later were relatively timely, I happened to have to change hotels after going out for fun on the first day. I felt very tired at night. The return flight on the last day was also delayed for nearly three hours. I also received a text message about the delay on the same trip. I didn't receive it until I returned to Shanghai, which made me speechless. The attitude of the customer service staff is okay, but the hotel that booked a lot of time in advance responded so late and said that there are only two days of rooms for three days. This is really unreasonable. In short, you need to think carefully before booking your itinerary.",Neutral

The rooms are a bit small, but fortunately there is a swimming pool and a gym. Xiamen is very hot, so it is recommended to wear sunscreen. I got a lot of tan. As for food, I had the best food at a seafood restaurant in Shapowei, and the price was relatively reasonable. The seafood in Gulangyu Island is very bad. The price is cheap, but the taste is really bad and the cooking is not good, so I recommend eating it. For good seafood, it’s better to eat in Xiamen. Let’s talk about Zhang Sanfeng milk tea in Gulangyu Island, it’s a scam! It’s really a shame that a small cup of 20 is not filled yet. Oh, I went to the underwater world on Gulangyu Island. Compared with other underwater worlds, it was really not that good. The sea lion show at the end made me embarrassed. The sea water in Xiamen and Gulangyu Island is not very clean. It is not recommended to swim in the water. It is good to step on the sand. And some of the food in Tsang Cuo An is quite reasonably priced, so you can give it a try. If you want to go, you'd better go shopping or something after 6 o'clock. After 6 o'clock, the sun sets, but it's not dark yet, and there is a sea breeze, which is very cool.

Two yuan is enough to transfer to all the tourist attractions. I really like Xiamen University. Besides, Gulangyu Island is very different from what I thought.

For example, before we went to Xiamen, we asked the consultant whether the hotel in Gulangyu Island provided pick-up and drop-off. The consultant said no. But when we arrived at the hotel, we found that the hotel could pick up and drop off at the pier. Because we listened to the consultant, we did not implement it for the hotel, which caused us great harm. I took the wrong path. Also, no staff took the initiative to contact us during the drop-off. We had to contact ourselves to confirm the time and location of the drop-off. Due to the losses caused by the flight delay, when asked, the consultant did not solve the problem reasonably and proactively. In the end, they only sent a link and we applied for insurance ourselves. The overall feeling was that the money had been paid and the subsequent work could not keep up.

That's the sea...I live so far away! It takes an hour to get to Zhongshan Road by bus, and a taxi costs 30. Think about it! In short: this product is very cost-effective! If you really want to go to Xiamen, just book a very cheap hotel and forget about it! Anyway, I regret it**!",Negative

When I arrived at the hotel, I was told that the hotel did not have my accommodation information. I was really speechless. What is the corporate culture of Tongcheng? Is it happy every day? I felt very depressed on the first day of travel. Hope it can improve.",Negative
3488,3488,"This trip will definitely be unforgettable. First of all, the so-called housekeeper from Tongcheng was really terrible. Since it was my first time to fly with a baby, I didn’t write down my ID number when filling in the child ticket information. When the ticket came out, they told me that I didn’t have an ID number. I couldn't register. Well, I paid the refund fee myself and rebooked the ticket. During this period, the so-called housekeeper made a phone call and I handled the other matters myself. The ticket fee was collected very quickly, and the refund money was waiting for half a month. The account hasn't been paid for a month. When I called and asked, I was told that I forgot. It's really haha. . . . . Secondly, the management of a company as big as Tongcheng is too chaotic. Let’s talk about the problem of the housekeeper first. After refunding and exchanging tickets, the travel contract sent to me did not have any changes. I contacted the housekeeper n times before it was revised. There were all the twists and turns during the process. It's tears. The hotel I booked originally had its own airport pick-up and drop-off service. When I called to make a reservation, I was told that since I booked through a certain **, I would not enjoy this service. I asked Tongcheng when to change my name. <br>But Xiamen is really beautiful, and the Jingmin Hotel is also good. It is located in the old city. There is a Sha Cha Noodles nearby that is much better than the one on Zhongshan Road.",Negative

On May 26th and 27th, they would stay at the Baolong Birman Hotel in Bailuzhou, Xiamen for 2 nights, and on the 28th night, they would stay at the Four Seasons Hotel on Gulangyu Island. The flight from Changzhou to Xiamen was already delayed that day. It was already around 21:00 when we arrived at the hotel. The hotel front desk informed us that there was no check-in information for 9 people and no reservations for us. I called Tongcheng again to report the situation. After about an hour, the hotel agreed to give me a call. We checked in. On the morning of the 27th, the same person called me again to inform me that there were no guest rooms for the night and asked us to pack our luggage and change to a hotel. Is this a joke? We agreed to change and the other party also promised to compensate us. They arranged for a driver to take us from the hotel to Gulangyu Pier on the 28th. We booked a ferry ticket for 3:50 pm on the 28th. The driver contacted me on the evening of the 27th and the morning of the 28th. Okay, we were waiting for us to get on the bus at the hotel at 3:10. On the 28th, we waited in front of the hotel at 3 o'clock for 10 minutes and called the driver to ask where we were. We just turned a corner and arrived at the intersection. At 30 minutes, we all got angry. The driver actually asked us to take a taxi to the pier. He was joking again. At 34 minutes, the driver's car drove all the way to the hotel entrance. The road was completely blocked and the car couldn't move. Finally, we arrived at the pier. The time was 3:53. The driver also said that we were in a hurry and it was useless for us to drag our suitcases and crawl to the ticket check-in area. Fortunately, there were still VIP tickets for 50 yuan per person after 4 o'clock that day, and then we went to the island. superior. I started calling to complain on the way to the pier, and I was told about compensation. However, until now on the same trip on the 31st, I was still asked about what happened, and the matter of compensation was shelved. The hotel check-in order was not placed, and the guest was temporarily asked to change hotels. The promised car was sent to the dock for compensation and it was a false order. What is the credibility of Tongcheng Travel? Where is the integrity? Where is the service? Are you just trying to trick and deceive guests into traveling?",Negative

It feels like a bit of a trap! I contacted Tongcheng’s customer service but received no reply in the end. Stayed for 3 nights and still had a big bed. . . The room layout is relatively narrow, and the spacious one does not have a sofa, which the old man is not satisfied with. The welcome fruits are also placed in one room, but there is nothing in the other room. At around 14:00 on the third day of our stay, the cleaning lady in the housekeeping department suddenly opened the door without permission.

It was already 12 o'clock. You guys Have you considered the elderly and children? <br>Tongcheng is also very rude. When dealing with emergencies, he said he would reply in half an hour, but it took an hour to reply. Moreover, the reply was still the hotel's excuse ~ ""I'll call you soon.""

Because we are traveling with children, the focus when looking at the options is accommodation and transportation. On the third night, I stayed at Lanting Yashu in Gulangyu Island. Don't look at the name, because there is another name that seems to have just changed hands. The location is hard to find, and it doesn't have a star rating at all.

3508,3508,"The most commendable thing about this trip is that the flights are very punctual and they arrive early, which is very good. But there are also a lot of troubles. First of all, children on Xiamen Airlines cannot select seats on their mobile phones, so they have to queue up at the airport to select seats for check-in. They can only sit in the back row. Secondly, when they arrived at the Xiamen hotel, they said there was no room and they said they had a 24-hour service. Check out at 12:00 hours, who are you kidding me? After checking in, the hotel description said check out before 12:00. I contacted Tongcheng customer service and waited for nearly an hour to complete the check-in. After checking in, I discovered that the so-called bay view room was not connected at all. There was no water at all. When we opened the curtains, we could see buildings everywhere. But the room opposite us was the house where we could actually see the water. I felt like I was being cheated. I called Tongcheng’s customer service and they said there was nothing they could do. It was a good trip. My mood suddenly dropped to freezing point. Fortunately, the buffet in the morning had more varieties. Thirdly, on the first night of my stay in the hotel, I got up and went to the bathroom and found a big bug crawling in the foyer. I asked my husband to get it out. It scared me all night. I didn't fall asleep. I asked the hotel staff the next morning and found out that it was a big cockroach unique to Xiamen. They said that you foreigners have never seen it before, so don't be afraid. Fourthly, for the 11:30 flight on the last day, I had to call 9 We left the hotel at :00. The hotel is less than 10 minutes away from the airport. Later, at my insistence, it was changed to 9:30. In the end, they found a dirty van to pick us up. We followed the commercial vehicle arranged after we got off the plane in Xiamen. Such a huge difference, is this intentional revenge? Our check-in ended at around 10:00, and we waited at the airport for an hour and a half in vain. I was really speechless. I hope that the Tongcheng platform can do a good job in advance and don’t just throw your hands at each other and say that you can’t do anything when encountering a problem.

From the environment to the service, it is one of the worst. We arrived a little late for breakfast. You see the guests are coming, you can ask before taking it, but they don't even ask, just take it away. Please tell me if I don't want to eat it, why should I charge a fee for breakfast? <br> Don't let the pictures fool you. **Fighter in the hotel. Just in time for the subway construction in Xiamen, this hotel has inconvenient transportation, the food is poor, and the swimming pool is as small as a bathhouse. The hotel also asked me to upgrade to a business-class suite for 150 yuan, which was too much. Who can see the sea and rely on Fox Tail Mountain, but I was blinded when I opened the door. I would like to ask, did you arrange the hotel in Tongcheng without inspecting it? <br> It was originally a 4-day trip, and I stayed in this hotel for 2 days. There are many things to do in Xiamen city, but the main thing is to go to Gulangyu Island. All right. Stay one night in Gulangyu Island. This trip is too rushed. I don’t know who designed the itinerary. I spent 8,700 on the same trip to book this crappy itinerary, and this is a lesson. Whoever goes to the Pannuo Holiday Inn in Gulangyu Island will regret it.

The attitude is also very good! <br>However, I am very dissatisfied with the attitude towards accommodation and customer service. On the first day of my stay, some guests’ intimate clothes were left in the room. I felt very uncomfortable and very dissatisfied! Logically speaking, a hotel like Pan Pacific shouldn't make such a low-level mistake! Not to mention the Gulangyu Hotel where I stayed the next day. When I checked in, I was not informed that there would be a power outage at 6 a.m. the next day. When I returned to the hotel after playing at 9 p.m., I found a power outage notice on the ground. Oh my god, it was so hot. Day, there was no air conditioning or hot water in the morning. It was really uncomfortable. The key was that they didn't inform us in advance, otherwise we could choose to change hotels and go back to the city. I am really dissatisfied that there is no air conditioning in such a hot weather! <br>The most speechless thing is our Tongcheng customer service! When I got back at 9 o'clock, I called the customer service to ask for help in coordinating and changing to a hotel with a store. The customer service said they would reply in half an hour! But I didn't receive a call for half an hour. When I called again, I still had to wait for half an hour. After that, there was still no news after half an hour. I continued to call, and finally said that the landline phone was not connected, and there was nothing I could do! I'm so angry! I did nothing during these two hours, just waiting for their solution!

3511,3511,"The hotel can only be regarded as a three-star hotel. I really don’t know how the so-called five-star hotel came to be. It is very shabby and old.

It was a good tour, with flights and wine, going to Juneyao Airlines, and returning to Spring and Autumn. The customer service on the same trip blamed us for not choosing the right one. Damn it, who matched this stupid flight? The price is not cheap. It is the first time to book the same trip, and it will also be the last time. There was one person in the middle who didn't make it. We had purchased cancellation insurance. We called customer service and they were told that we had to cancel one day in advance. After some effort, we were able to get a refund of 365 yuan for a flight ticket. **Ah, so what if I bought cancellation insurance? Buy to watch or play?

He said there was a traffic jam and asked me to wait for a while. Okay, I'll wait. Later, he called me again, but he didn't receive it. I called him back, and he directly said, don't call me over and over again. Don't you know that if someone catches someone driving and making phone calls under surveillance here, we will be fined? I explained that it was you who called me, so I called back. The receptionist directly told me that I would hang up while you were on the phone, please stop calling me over and over again. I was speechless at that time. A few minutes after hanging up the phone, the attendant on the same trip called me and asked me to arrange a pick-up person for me. Sincerely, it’s really uncomfortable to wait under the sun for so long. I don’t need you to arrange a pick-up person myself. Use your mobile phone to call a private car.

When I came back and told my friends about this situation, they all said that Tongcheng.com was not good. It was common for them to encounter such situations. They only had this ability. Finally, I booked the hotel through **.com. Check-in was also very fast, very satisfied! Because of a friend, I booked a 6-day free trip to Xiamen through Tongcheng customer service on July 29 this year. I didn’t expect that the past would be hard to look back on. When I arrived at the hotel, the hotel told me that there was no relevant information about me, so I couldn't check in normally. I called the customer service staff and it took me two hours to check into the hotel. It was the same situation for four consecutive days. I don't know how I can be trusted by such low service quality. When I checked in at the airport on August 3, I was informed by the airport customer service that the flight was cancelled. During this period, I did not receive any relevant flight cancellation information from customer service on the same journey. I called customer service and didn't know the flight was cancelled. Don't know how it works. From now on, I will never choose this same trip again, and I will also tell my friends not to choose such a company! I also hope that everyone can take this as a warning.

All the customer service staff on the same journey had to call themselves for consultation and would not call to care about us at all. Because I have children, I also added a home drop-off service, which was really excessive. Because the flight was delayed, the 7:30 plane did not arrive in Xiamen until early in the morning. The driver’s phone was turned off before boarding the plane. I sent text messages and made numerous phone calls. I couldn't get through, so I contacted the pick-up staff and told me to ask for a driver. I couldn't find a taxi to the hotel. I was unfamiliar with the place and the children were asleep. I asked a scalper to go to the hotel. This made me very angry. ! I called and complained the next day, but nothing came of it. What I said had nothing to do with Tongcheng! Sheraton had a musty smell that was unbearable, but the service staff was quite kind... The third day was at a hotel on Gulangyu Island. Because Gulangyu Island was closed, I had no choice but to call for consultation. The customer service staff on the same trip said that I would go and find out more about it. I called back later, but there was no news. Later, I called again and was told that the hotel would arrange for us to stay in the original hotel. However, the hotel said that it had not received a reservation from ** at all, which meant that we had to sleep on the third night. On the street, I have been going back and forth between the hotel and Tongcheng. You must know that the staff of Tongcheng told me that the reservation was made the night before. When I arrived at the hotel front desk, there was nothing. It took me half a day and it was not given until 11:30. I solved it, but they also used the excuse that it was a communication problem in the hotel. They were all quibbles. No one called me to explain it clearly. I took the initiative to call customer service. It was super frustrating! I had a flight at around 6 o'clock this morning. I was afraid that I would encounter the same experience as the airport pick-up, so I called the same number and asked the driver to call me during his busy schedule. It turned out that the driver was busy and would call me later, and nothing happened after that. ...Later, I called the driver myself at night and agreed to leave at five o'clock. At 4:45 in the morning, I couldn't get through to the driver. I continued to call and turned off the phone. It took several calls to get through. The driver said he had forgotten... Really I was very angry. The experience of picking up and dropping off from the airport and making the hotel reservation made me very angry. No customer service staff on the same journey took the initiative to call and apologize! Although I can understand the difficulties caused by the typhoon, my experience was really depressing...

For those who want to enjoy a slow-paced life and have an in-depth experience in Xiamen, this itinerary should not be chosen. Now let’s talk about the shortcomings: 1. The hotel accommodation is too far away. Although the Sheraton Hotel is a five-star hotel, its location is not good. It is far away from Zhongshan Road, Xiamen University, Gulangyu Island, Wuyuan Bay, etc. It takes about an hour by bus and more than 30 yuan by taxi. For the same price, you can stay at the 100-year-old ""Lujiang Hotel"" in Xiamen. 2. The accommodation on Gulangyu Island is terrible. Pannuo Resort Hotel is located next to Neicuoao Pier on Gulangyu Island. There is no scenic spot around it. Please note that there is no scenic spot. All attractions and eating places are near Sanqiutian Pier. Because Gulangyu Island is a pedestrian island, it takes about 40 minutes to walk to the scenic spots from the hotel, and the price is not cheap. For the same price, you can stay at the famous ""Zhongdeji Villa Hotel"" on the island. 3. In Xiamen, it is difficult to get a taxi on Sunday night, so because the hotel is too far away, I took a taxi for an hour on the road but still couldn’t get a taxi. In the end, I took a bus for an hour. This kind of I don’t want to experience life a second time. More than 300 yuan was spent on transportation. <br>Finally, in summary, apart from the tour group’s services, the rest of my travel experience was great. The only thing I am satisfied with may be the service of the airport pick-up and drop-off driver. If you want to choose this itinerary, you must be careful!",Negative
3527,3527,"The first time I booked on the same trip, it was the worst. The Changchun-Xiamen flight was delayed. There was no luggage check-in, so I had to pay for it myself. There was no round-trip check-in, 10kg each. It cost 280 yuan to go to Gulangyu Island. I had to book the ticket in advance. If I didn’t, it was very likely. I couldn't go to Tongcheng and no one reminded me to book in advance, so my trip was very fast on Gulangyu Island and there was no sightseeing at all. To put it bluntly, I went to Gulangyu Island and stayed for one night. When I called the customer service, they were very blunt and said that they had no obligation to verbally inform me to buy the ferry ticket in advance. If you want to come to Xiamen, it’s better not to book such uneconomical spring and autumn flights. It’s very cheap. You can book the hotel by yourself online and it’s not that expensive. If you want to come, plan ahead by yourself. A trip for two is one or two thousand cheaper than this one. It’s so fast. I really don’t recommend booking this one.

However, because the hotel address and phone number on the tour notice given to me were all wrong, I walked around with my luggage on the car-free island for most of the day. Such hot weather made me cross a Gulangyu Island! Don’t you guys check it out? Look carefully when copying and pasting! ! It’s rare that my husband and I have time to go out and play for a few days. A good day was wasted without any fun, the whole trip was just walking around. I will never travel with Tongcheng again with this attitude.

I don’t understand that my group of 5980 has nothing. Nan Putuo includes a vegetarian buffet, but I didn’t have a single meal for 4 days and 3 nights. I spent money on the buffet and didn’t follow the procedures written in the itinerary. I received a complimentary night tour of Lujiang, but the customer service said they would send me a text message verification code?

3534,3534,"Hey, it was a very bad trip. Of course, most of it was not due to the tour group. First of all, the flight to Xiamen Airport was delayed for four hours on the first day. It was already past 12 o'clock at night when we arrived at the hotel. I slept for six hours and had to start again the next morning. The day's trip was very tiring, and since we were the only two of us, we couldn't eat lunch, so we had to take care of it ourselves. Xiamen is said to be close to the sea, but the seafood and home-cooked dishes at ordinary stalls are very expensive, weighing a pound. The price of fish is more than 100, and eating a fish costs at least 150, so each meal costs 150-200. The next day's trip to Gulangyu Island arrived at 2:30 pm due to heavy fog. Half a day was wasted. The day's trip was compressed into 3 hours. Some scenic spots were not visited, lunch was also cancelled, and it became a matter of self-sufficiency. (Of course, all the money that should be refunded has been refunded). The Pannuo Hotel in Gulangyu Island is really bad. It is not even as good as a fast hotel, but it is still a high-end hotel. The conditions are really bad! Let’s talk about the airport pick-up again. Because the flight was delayed many times, we didn’t receive one. In the end, after communicating with the ground pick-up, we took a taxi and got reimbursed. Because we had to accommodate other guests, we were sent to the airport early, which was a waste of time for fun. In fact, we could have done it. There is no need for a drop-off service, because later I saw that the bus from the pier to the airport only costs 10 yuan, and you can control the time yourself. In short, due to various delays, the whole trip was very rushed, not smooth and very tiring! Let’s talk about Xiamen Airport. The punctuality rate of the entire airport is only over 30%. Almost all flights will be delayed. Dear friends, please be mentally prepared when you are going. A delay of one or two hours is considered a good thing! In the end, the tour guide's service was good, and any problems would be solved through coordination.",Negative
3535,3535,"Family members said that this trip to Xiamen was far different from the last trip to Beijing. <br>1. The service in Beijing was very enthusiastic when picking up the driver. They told stories and chatted on the way, and even printed tickets for families when they went to the airport. However, the family members of the pick-up driver in Xiamen asked how far it was to the driver, but the driver Ignoring is very cold. <br>2. Fortunately, the family members carefully verified the details of the group departure notice, otherwise the tour guide would have asked the family members to pay an additional 30 yuan/person for the buffet (the buffet notice clearly included it, but the tour guide said that her notice did not include it) , The family member will only let it go if they present it on their own initiative). <br>3. I strongly protested that I didn’t take my family members to visit the scenic spot “Yuyuan Garden”. In the end, my family members took the initiative to verify the tour notice and found out. At that time, the trip was over. When I asked the tour guide, the tour guide said we didn’t mention it? What is the logic? Families pay for the tour. You and the tour guide know best which activities to enjoy. You deliberately omit the activities but blame the family members for not reminding them. How is this unreasonable? You should compensate and refund! <br>4. Due to the poor time arrangement of the tour guide, there was no time to see the twelve holes in ""Shuzhuang Garden"", so the tour guide said that he would gather. <br>To sum up, Tongcheng Tourism needs to strengthen the supervision and assessment of the overall reception service awareness of local tour operators and the personal quality level of tour guides. Only those who believe in Tongcheng choose Tongcheng. We can tolerate your changes but cannot tolerate your changes. Feedback and suggestions from customers are handled lightly and in a process-like manner, and then they still go their own way.

As a result, my free time was delayed all afternoon. I didn’t check in until the evening with the help of the Xiamen tour guide. Taigu Hotel, as a result, every day of travel was accompanied by complaints and problem solving, requiring us to pay 270 yuan for room difference every night. After we argued hard and provided strong evidence, Tongcheng finally admitted that it was wrong and waived the housing difference and reimbursed the taxi fare. Although the result was that we won, our travel time was disrupted, and at the same time, we were annoyed and angry every day by the customer service staff who were trying to solve the problem. If we were not so powerful, if we were the weak and incompetent people, we would definitely not be able to win this dispute! I would like to inform everyone to be careful and not to be fooled!

( When shopping online, you always keep the mobile phone number of the staff on the same trip). You should at least tell the customer.

If Tongcheng staff told me in advance, I could choose other means of transportation to go back. The important thing is that there is none, and the customer service phone number cannot be reached.

3544,3544,"I am a group of two people who went out on the first day of the lunar new year. I generally feel bad. I don’t know how it is usually. Now I will tell you about my travel experience for a few days. I arrived at Xiamen Airport at 8:30 in the morning on the first day of the lunar new year. From getting off the plane to picking up After finishing my luggage, I walked out of the airport without any pick-up personnel contacting me. After making a call, I contacted the pick-up personnel. The pick-up personnel replied that I would wait for 20 minutes and that we would go to the hotel with the next flight. I said that it was okay after all. The contract clearly stated that I had to wait for 30 minutes. I waited there for 50 minutes and no one informed me to leave. I went to the airport pick-up staff to ask what was going on. He replied that he was nervous about waiting for the bus. I After looking at the roster of pick-up personnel, I saw that the people who arrived after us had already been arranged to leave. We had to wait for a while, so I asked the staff why the ones who arrived first in order were not left first? Just then, a driver next to us asked us to get in his car and leave first. How many flights did the pick-up staff pick up in a day? How many people will be picked up in total? What hotels do you stay at? How to arrange a vehicle? Don’t you need to do all this in advance? After getting on the bus, there were two families with nine people on board, half of whom were on the bus, and they were unwilling to get off. It took another 20 minutes to adjust. There were 14 people in the bus plus the driver. The driver started from the first bus. He started making two phone calls non-stop in the car, and they didn't finish until we got off the car. We were dropped off at the third hotel. The drive took an hour and a half, and his phone calls didn't stop for a minute during this hour and a half. Checking in at the hotel was very fast. After settling in, I took a rest. I had no schedule on the first day. I received a call from the tour guide in Wuyi Mountain at around 8 o'clock in the evening asking us what time we would arrive at Wuyi Mountain on the third day. I replied to him that the tour guide in Xiamen was still there. No one contacted us, and I didn’t know the specific time. At around nine o’clock in the evening, the tour guide in Xiamen finally contacted us and said that he had mistaken my phone number, so he only contacted us now. It’s understandable that there are so many people celebrating the New Year. The day trip to Gulangyu Island the next day was generally good. The tour guide Chen Xiaoshu was very enthusiastic and arranged it well. The ticket I booked to go to Wuyi Mountain on the third day was relatively late. The tour guide in Wuyi Mountain was afraid that I would not be able to catch up with the rafting, so I reminded me in advance to change to an earlier bus. The trip to Wuyi Mountain went smoothly on the third day, but the weather was not kind. It rained a little and the wind was very cold! The tour guide Zhang was very nice and reminded us how to eat economically. On the fourth day of the itinerary, we were not able to participate because we were cold and unwell the day before. Tour guide Zhang contacted the hotel to let us check out later so that we could have more rest. In the afternoon, we were sent to the station and took the high-speed train back to Xiamen. I thought that was all the itinerary for the day. It was over. I never expected that the problem would arise again. I arrived in Xiamen at 8:30 in the evening and got on the bus. I was waiting to go back to the hotel. The driver said that there were two more people who had not arrived yet and asked him to wait. This wait was enough. It took almost two hours, and when the driver called to confirm, the two of them had already asked other cars to take them back to the hotel. As a result, more than a dozen people in a car arrived at the hotel after 11 o'clock in the evening, and they were all hungry. After checking in at the hotel, I thought I could have a good rest. When I was lying on the bed, there was a buzzing sound in my ears. I couldn't fall asleep at all. In Room 522, I called and said there were no vacancies and I couldn't change it.

When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk said we would upgrade to a parent-child room for free, which was great! The parent-child room has one large bed and one small bed, so my friend and I would take turns sleeping in the large bed one day each! On the night of July 1st, my son and I slept on the big bed on the first day. I slept that night without any discomfort, and there were no mosquitoes or anything! I woke up at 5 a.m. on July 2 and went to the bathroom without any discomfort! It wasn’t until around 7 o’clock on July 2 that I realized something was wrong. My body was very itchy and there were many big red bumps. Of course, I thought they were mosquitoes because the airport pick-up attendant said that mosquitoes in Xiamen are very powerful... I didn’t pay attention at the time, so I didn’t follow him. The hotel said! So begins a day of fun! We returned to the hotel at about 8 o'clock that night.

I saw the same red lumps as me! At that time, I didn’t know it was a flea, until I posted it on Moments, and people immediately said it was a flea bite, so I searched on Baidu, and sure enough, it was the same as the one on me! Do we still dare to sleep? We immediately called the person in charge of the hotel to come over. At first, a woman came over. She looked at it and said that I had a lot of lumps on my body, but she also said that their hotel was very clean! She said that they would either change the sheets and mattresses for us, and also apply potion on the sheets, but we didn't agree. This would not solve the problem. Later, her leader (a male manager) asked us if we had been to other places. We were here for a trip, so of course we had to go out. Later, the manager asked us to change rooms, and we could only change rooms at that time. We were here for a trip, and we didn’t want to go through too much trouble, so we agreed to change rooms!

During this period, Tongcheng did not provide any services, so they had to make phone calls by themselves. The airline told me that there is no delay insurance, but the travel accident insurance only costs 200 yuan per person, and only compensates for one-way delays, and the claim information is cumbersome and takes up to 15 working days! In the past, it took 1-2 working days for the claim to be settled when purchasing air tickets on **. Why does it take so long for the same trip? Moreover, the clause that compensation can only be paid for one way was also explained verbally by Tongcheng. Why didn't you explain it clearly to me before I paid? Now we can only passively accept it? I was very angry. I didn’t feel any service from Tongcheng during the whole process. I had to solve it myself. So why should I book through Tongcheng? Moreover, the person handling the matter is different every time. The same thing has to be said many times, and in the end I still don’t get a definite answer.

Overall, I was not tired at the end of the day, it was pretty good, and the group meal was pretty good. <br>After eight o'clock in the evening, Huang Qinqin, a tour guide from Xiamen, contacted me to confirm the time. I was going to Gulangyu Island the next day. This tour guide walked really fast. After explaining, he walked forward without stopping. The team members chased after him and took photos. I gave up. To be honest, I was a little nervous. The group meal was supposed to be included, but it was not included and the meal fee was refunded. <br>On the third day, it was tour guide Huang again, but I felt that the itinerary was too tight. Because the buses were used repeatedly, I didn’t go to Xiamen University and Zengcuo’an. The tour guide kept saying that she had told me to give up on the bus. We went to Xiamen University by ourselves, but my colleagues and I clearly heard: Those who are going to Nan Putuo, we will meet at the gate at 11:15. Those who are not going to Nan Putuo will go to Xiamen University by themselves. I don’t know that we are going to Nan Putuo. People can't go to Xiamen University, which is why I didn't go to Xiamen University in the end. After coming out of Nanputuo, she took a group of people to take a bus to Zengcuo'an. She asked me to take down my luggage and go to the train station by myself. It was 11:30 and my high-speed train to Wuyishan was at 15:40. She said she was afraid. After I went to Zengcuo'an, the bus couldn't come back, and I couldn't get my luggage. I was afraid that I would be late getting to the train station, but it was obviously late that morning. According to the itinerary, I should arrive at 9:30. Zeng Cuo'an, I should arrive at Xiamen University at 11:30.

This will be a lifelong regret. ah. <br>The tour guide in Wuyishan is very responsible. He contacted me two days in advance to ask about my train number. He has a very good attitude and takes good care of his fellow travelers. It’s just because of the Chinese New Year that I really don’t dare to have a group meal on the last day. Please leave more reviews... But the hotel I stayed in in Wuyishan was very good and clean. It was the best I have stayed in these days. <br>The negative reviews are all about the itinerary for that day in Xiamen. Nanputuo, Zengcuo'an, and Xiamen University were really not well arranged.

There wasn't even a small piece of soap. The hotel's front desk service attitude was particularly poor. We talked about a 4 days and 3 nights tour, but there was no one at all. We arrived at the hotel at around 1am on the first day. The next day we went to Baicheng Beach and Gulangyu Island. On the third day we left the hotel at 8:45 in the morning and went to Xiamen University and Nanputuo Temple. We arrived at the hotel at 2:40. It was equivalent to following the tour guide for a day and a half, which was not cost-effective at all. It's not as good as the travel notice said when I placed the order. The tour guide's arrangement was unreasonable. The Baicheng Beach that he took us to the next morning was unreasonable. We should have been taken to the beach at 3pm, and the rest of the time was for free activities. There was no one to follow us during the trip, and we only had to wait until we returned. Someone was following up, but it was already too late. Problems arose and were not solved in time. On the fourth day, I checked out of the hotel at 12 o'clock on my return trip. I negotiated with Tongcheng's customer service to check out at 1 o'clock, and the customer service said it was OK. As a result, the front desk of the hotel made 4 calls in half an hour, and the calls kept going. Finally, the cleaning lady came and knocked on the door 3 times.

Sound insulation is very poor! Below are photos of the hotel! I really couldn't bear it, so I had to check out and change to a hotel. I only got a refund of 390 for 3 days.

After hanging up the customer service phone number, I called the hotel on my itinerary and found a room! And it was a lot. In the end, I stayed in a boutique hotel for 3 days and traveled for 2 days.

The first time I chose Tongcheng to book a group tour, I wanted to save worry. However, I encountered problems starting from the first day of travel. There were three people in the group. One of them wrote the wrong name when booking a flight for Tongcheng. He was stopped at the security check and refused to board the plane. I immediately called the emergency contact person whom I had texted the day before to inform me that I could call if I had any problems. The response I got was that I couldn’t find the person now and I had to call the 400 number myself. I had no choice but to call 4007777777 and was told that my name was wrong and I couldn't change it, so I had to buy a new ticket. Seeing that the boarding time was about to end, it was discovered that the person with the wrong name was an old man. I had to rush to the China Eastern Airlines ticket office where the flight belonged. I was told that I could not buy tickets for this flight. The only flight on the same day was the afternoon first class. We had no choice but to spend three times the price to buy a first-class seat. We repeatedly asked the old man who had never traveled alone to keep his mobile phone open. After we got off the plane, we called to give instructions on how to board the plane to Xiamen alone. Afterwards, with my underage children in tow, I hurried to the boarding gate amidst the incomprehensible insults from other passengers queuing up for security check, and barely missed getting on the plane. After landing, I called 400 again to deal with various remaining issues, but only received a reply that the ticket that did not board the plane could only be refunded, and it was a refund with loss. I was responsible for the price difference of the ticket I purchased myself. What kind of God is it that because of your work mistakes, all three of me and my party were almost unable to go, and the losses incurred can only be borne by yourself? I also know that the road to rights protection is long, and it is very likely that the final result will be unfair. It is also very likely that my negative review will be deleted by the company.

Not a single link can be connected, so why talk about the gold medal route, strict product selection, high-quality itinerary, and service guarantee? What exactly have been achieved? ! This credibility is too bad! Tour guides are required to follow up and lead the group. We are not traveling independently, so how can we treat users like this! I am very disappointed.

The flight could not be confirmed and the booking was changed to the next day. The travel time could not be postponed. The return ticket was the same journey. No one is allowed to change the ticket, and there is an additional fee of 5,000 yuan for changing the ticket. The food and accommodation are different from those introduced! Bad review!

I met the tour guide in the morning and on the bus to the scenic spot, I was told that the itinerary would be changed for two days. After being reminded by the tourists in the group, the tour guide realized that lunch was included and that lunch was vegetarian. In the afternoon, we had free time to visit Zengcuo'an. Originally, the tour guide said that we would meet at 3:30 and then leave for Jimei. At 2:30, we were told that the meeting time had been changed to 4:00. At 4:00, the bus still didn't come, so we waited until 4:15 because Dabao was on his way to pick up another group of tourists, but there was a traffic jam. Arrive at Jimei after 5 o'clock, and prepare to return for dinner at 6 o'clock. Originally, we planned to eat Southern Fujian food that night, but the tour guide on the bus said to switch to seafood meal. When we arrived at the hotel, we waited until 8 o'clock to have dinner. It was already over when we returned to the hotel. It's 9 o'clock. On the way, we repeatedly asked the tour guide if we could go to Gulangyu Island later the next day, because everyone had been working hard all day and wanted to get up later. The tour guide said that we bought the boat ticket for 9:10 and could not meet up later. We gathered at the hotel at 8 a.m. the next day. On the bus, we were told by the tour guide that we bought the ferry ticket for 10:10. We had to wait at the ferry port. Later we swiped our ID cards and found that the ticket time had changed to It's 10:50, so our group has been waiting the whole morning, wasting time. When boarding the ship to check in, the tour guide did not gather the crowd in time, so our group of 10 adults and 4 children was divided into two ships to land on the island. After landing on the island, we had to gather and wait again. After gathering, everyone was hungry and went straight to eat. After dinner, we started our trip to Gulangyu Island. Because the tour guide did not have the habit of gathering people, and he always walked at the front, there were always people in our group getting separated. . . . . . This trip to Xiamen was really bad. Hey, I complained to Tongcheng during this period and said they would verify it, but so far I haven't received any response.

They said they misheard, and then after coordination, they asked me to increase the room rate! He also told me that if it were 5 days and 4 nights, it wouldn’t be at this price! Then they asked me to add more than 500 yuan. I thought it was too much and asked them if they could get a discount. The staff told me that they had already borne the cost of changing the booking, so they couldn't give me a discount. I think you should bear the cost of changing the booking. Are the fees correct? Because you yourself heard it wrong! Then he called me again a while later and said that the hotel room fee was over 200 for me! Got me a cheaper room! I was quite happy and paid off the extra money! Then our first day of itinerary began. Unexpectedly, my flight was delayed. The staff informed me that the flight was canceled again. The staff said that if they could give me the hotel money, they would refund me more than 200.

He also said that this is a rule, which statement is true? I missed a day of fun and you didn't compensate me. You set the wrong date and asked me for money! Then he lied to me. It was obviously more than 200 for two rooms. He also told me that he gave me a discount. If the flight hadn't been cancelled, I wouldn't have known about it until now!

The accommodation at 12 noon was vacant for half the day, and there was no customer service or personnel from Tongcheng to inform us. After calling and responding to Tongcheng, the customer service staff arranged by Tongcheng to solve the problem was very funny, saying that the international practice is Check out at 12 o'clock, I should know this. The question is, what time is the hotel's customary check-out time? You keep talking about this with me. The main problem is that the late-night flight and hotel you booked for me only accommodated me until noon. No one has informed me that I am responsible for the half-day vacancy in the middle.

We checked in at night and arrived at the hotel to inquire about the next day’s trip. According to the itinerary, we were informed that there was a typhoon in Xiamen, so we were allowed to move around freely. The other tourists in my hotel adjusted their activities in the city the next day. I communicated by phone again, and we were still free to move around. I really want to ask you if I can accept the adjustment, but if you can’t adjust it and the adjustment is gone, then what else do I need to do with the group? I can just go on my own. Moreover, the tour guides are changed every day. At the Zhenjiang Tongcheng store, we have already told us what to do if a typhoon affects the trip. The store receptionist said that they would only adjust the order of the tour and not move to free activities. We just paid, but after collecting the money, there were problems one by one.

The reason given by the tour guide was that there was a traffic jam, but in fact there was no one to pick up the car and the tour guide was waiting at the meeting point. Moreover, the time arrangement along the way was unreasonable, and time was wasted waiting for tickets and people. The driver of the second car had a bad attitude.

After I complained many times, they compensated me one-third of the amount, more than 3,000 yuan. When traveling to Xiamen, I suggest you go on your own. It’s not fun to go with a group. The tour guide took us for a walk on Gulangyu Island for six hours, and we didn’t go to any of the paid attractions. The next day, they showed us a list of free attractions.

The room we stayed in was said to be an ocean view room, but with trees in front of it, we might as well have been called a tree view room. The transportation in this hotel is even more inconvenient. You can't call a taxi at all. There is a car in the hotel, but the price is twice as expensive as a taxi. The most irritating thing is the tour guide. Apart from collecting money to be energetic, all the other things a tour guide should do are confused. There is also a discrepancy in the amount of money collected for self-financed projects. For a while, it was said that children get half the price, and when we got there, they said that children need full price. When we went to the ticket window and asked, she said that children can get 20% off, and then she said 20% off. I have met at least a dozen tour guides, but none of them are like her! ! !

3619,3619,"This trip made me really doubt Tongcheng’s service. I have always felt that Tongcheng's service quality is very good, so I convinced my parents-in-law to choose Tongcheng for their trip this time. However, various problems arose. 1. My parents-in-law arrived in Xiamen on the first day, but there was no one to pick them up. There was a pick-up and drop-off in the itinerary. I contacted the person in the itinerary and they said that the pick-up person went to the wrong station. I would like to ask, is it possible to ask which station the tourists should get off at? Not sure? 2. The second day’s itinerary was an in-depth tour of Gulangyu Island. As a result, the tour guide we led that day said that he had self-funded projects before going to Gulangyu Island, and even asked him to sign a satisfaction survey form. I just want to ask, since we haven’t done any major itineraries yet, why do we only charge self-paid items and still need to sign a satisfaction sign? 3. When I returned to the hotel at the end of the second day's trip, it was eight o'clock in the evening. I left the two parents halfway and let them walk back to the hotel. If it was a five-minute trip, forget it. It turned out that it took nearly an hour for my parents-in-law to arrive. I called them. I asked the tour guide if the route was correct, but the tour guide couldn't answer. He could only ask the directions himself before arriving at the hotel. If the two old people encounter any danger on the road, how should they bear this responsibility? 4. Tour guides for self-funded projects on Gulangyu Island all charged the full price of the parents-in-law. The National Tourism Administration has regulations that tickets for seniors over 60 years old are half price. So where did the extra money go? I doubt whether such a tour guide is qualified to practice?",Negative
3620,3620,"First of all, the customer service misled me about the accommodation address and made me think it was that hotel. Because it was a semi-self-service hotel, I organized the independent travel itinerary. The airport pick-up man picked us up at around 1 o'clock in the morning on the first day and sent us to another inn. I didn't say anything. I thought it was too late and contacted us the next day. When we arrived at the village entrance of the inn, they dropped us off and told us that they couldn't get in and we didn't know how to get there. Moreover, the driver asked us to contact the tour guide at two o'clock in the morning, so we talked to the tour guide. After communicating with the staff, the tour guide said he didn’t know what to say and became impatient and said he had to go to bed and asked us to talk tomorrow. After that, the driver helped us ask for our phone number. Then someone from the inn drove an electric car to pick us up. After we arrived at the inn, we paid the deposit and went up to sleep. There were no less than ten cockroaches on the carpet, crawling on the floor, and the quilts were all next to each other. We just changed rooms. The room was a little better than the previous one, but the cleanliness was still worse than that of a fast hotel (there is no higher requirement for them to do a series of things). Second The tour guide in Gulangyu Island during the day trip also said in a complaining tone that he was very tired and someone called him early in the morning to sell me a product. When I called the customer service, no one answered the phone. He also said that the signal was not good in foreign countries and asked me to call the customer service of the same journey.

They only talked to me and said sorry to me. They didn’t do anything practical. I was so disappointed with Tongcheng. Without asking for compensation, I just want everyone to see that something went wrong. No one cares about personal safety and there is no guarantee.

I guess it's because I expected too much, or because it was a free trip and the price was cheap, my attitude was bad. First of all, the driver who picked us up in Xiamen didn't even call us. I found him entirely by myself. His attitude was also bad. He seemed to blame us for missing our flight. He also didn't send us to the hotel and made us wait at the airport for half a day. Many hours. Then let’s talk about the inn. Who said that the boss is handsome and nice? I really want to complain. His attitude is too bad. He is also very impatient. If he is not a customer, he is God. The key card in our room is broken. He gave The solution was to let us go to bed. Can we sleep without turning on the air conditioner when the weather is over 30 degrees in Xiamen? Later, we did it ourselves. Whenever we called, we would be very impatient and would not clean every day. The room was just run down**. The tour guide was okay, so I just followed him for a day. And Xiamen is a scam. The price is clearly marked on the wall at 15, but when you pay, it becomes 28. . . . Xiamen gave me a really bad feeling. . .

Carrying heavy luggage is inconvenient especially on rainy days. The suitcase was filled with mud, water and sand. It’s even more inconvenient for girls! The cleanliness of the inn is very average. After three days of stay, the cleaning lady only fried eggs until they were dry, and every corner of the room was covered in dust. Xiamen is suitable for those so-called ""literary and fresh people"" to travel. Older people like me have experienced nothing but Gulangyu Island. The drop off at the airport on the return day was really depressing! The good time I had agreed with the ""convoy captain"" the night before was 5:30 the next morning, but the woman told the driver to pick me up at 5:50, and made me wait in the heavy rain for more than 20 minutes in the morning.

However, when you** she just responded when it was convenient for you and ignored you when it was not convenient for you. Something went wrong on the day of the trip. Her name was changed to call the customer service number during the break. Her name is Qian Chunling. The flight that was supposed to be at 11 o'clock on the first day sent me a text message at 7 o'clock in the morning asking me to go to the airport. I arrived at the airport at 8.40, and the text message came again and told me that it would not take off until 14.30 in the afternoon. Are you saying it's annoying? Then I started complaining to someone at 8.40 to help me resolve the flight change. It wasn’t until 10.13 that someone called me back to ask. During this period, I changed my flight at 12.40. Where is the same-way service? I made more than 10 calls back and forth, and it wasn't until 14.30 that I stopped at the Jinan Complaints Department before anyone called me back. Handle my business. I called numerous times before my flight took off and no one got back to me. When I arrived in Xiamen at 18 o'clock, the people from the complaint department gave me a satisfactory result. Because if I was not satisfied, I could do anything and go to Xiamen. But who would have thought that this was just the beginning and not the end. When I arrived in Xiamen, the driver asked me which hotel I was staying in. I said I didn’t know because no one told me. When I arrived at the hotel, it was a family hotel, but I didn't expect the boss to give me the shabbiest room on the first floor without a window. The sheets were used and there were cigarette butts in the bucket. I had to hold the cigarette butts in my hands to take a shower. When I wanted to change rooms, the boss said there were no rooms. Let me deal with it. Later, I firmly refused to negotiate with the local tour guide. Something strange happened. The boss said that there was room 309. This is deception. Since it was already 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, I complained and no one answered the phone. I had to wait until 8.30 in the morning to continue my complaint and ask to change hotels. The girl in the complaint department was speechless after hearing my experience and tried her best to help me solve the problem to my satisfaction. I changed hotels after two nights. However, this is how I spent my trip to Xiamen, and this is what happened to me on this route. It was also said that a detailed introduction would be received the day before departure. I only received flight information and nothing else. I didn’t know the name of the hotel until I arrived at the hotel. If I hadn't fought hard for my rights, my trip to Xiamen would have been even worse. An unforgettable complaint journey.

I spent most of my time in a car, and the city is congested everywhere. We were under construction. I was tired. I was tired. I was tired. I changed rooms several times but it was not ideal.

As a consumer, I trust your platform and book a four-day, three-night semi-self-guided trip to Xiamen with you. , Beijing Nanyuan Airport arrived at Xiamen five hours late on the first day. I didn’t say much. No one wanted the flight to be delayed, and no one could do anything about it. It was already around 6 pm after arriving in Xiamen, and the first day of the trip was basically over. Yes, there was no problem with Gulangyu Island on the second day, no problem with free travel on the third day, and I returned on the fourth day. I arrived at the airport around 5:30. I waited until around 10 p.m. to be notified of the flight cancellation, and contacted the customer service staff in Beijing as soon as possible. They gave me the answer. I hurriedly bought my own return ticket and asked if it would be reimbursed. There was no accurate answer. I asked for a reply after work the next day. I contacted the hotel that night, which was near the airport. I went to the hotel to rest at 12 o'clock and waited for the reply. The next day at 10 o'clock in the morning. The reply message I got was that I should contact the airline to change or refund the ticket, or buy the ticket myself, and bear the fare difference myself. They said that the flight issue has nothing to do with **. Originally, we should have arrived in Beijing today, and my husband still has work commitments. Listen I was really angry and disappointed when I received such a reply. After buying my ticket, I stayed at the airport for a whole day waiting for the flight. I arrived in Beijing at 3 a.m. on the third day and took a taxi home. When I woke up in the morning, the staff from Tongcheng headquarters gave me a message. The reply was that I would bear the difference in ticket price and all the losses caused by the flight delay. In fact, I didn’t ask for any compensation at all. They just gave me the difference in flight price. I also didn’t buy a flight that was very different from the original ticket price. The price difference was also small. It’s only 140 yuan. I took a taxi home from the airport and it cost 155 yuan. I only asked you for the price difference and didn’t mention anything else. You said it was all the airline’s problem. Is that the airline you chose? You don’t know this airline. Is the company prone to this problem? Even the check-in counter in Xiamen told us not to book this airline. Don’t you know? I don’t even want to talk about the physical and mental exhaustion of this journey. A good vacation has been ruined. I don’t want to complain to you. Doesn’t your conscience hurt?

The next day, the tour guide took us to Gulangyu Island. After we got to the island, we kept walking. It was hot and sunny. When it was time to eat at noon, we were not given time to eat. Fortunately, we brought some small tomatoes to replenish our energy. We continued shopping for a few more hours, and finally had free time to move around and eat... Alas, at the end of the day, not only did I not eat on time, but my face was sunburned (sunscreen and sun-protective clothing didn't help)... At night When we returned to the hotel, the air conditioner was turned on at 16 degrees and there was no cooling at all.

There will be no activities on that day. On the 15th, we will go on a one-day tour to Gulangyu Island, travel on our own on the 16th, and return on the 17th. <br> I arrived in Xiamen on the morning of the 14th, and strong winds began to blow in the afternoon. The locals said that a typhoon was coming, and the government announced that work, production, and schools had been suspended. . . Three days in advance, the whole city had begun preparations for typhoon prevention. When I heard about it, I went crazy. . . Sure enough, the typhoon came in the evening. Needless to say how powerful it was, the news should have reported it. Traffic in the city was paralyzed. You couldn't go anywhere, not even the city. You could only stay where you lived. The place where I live has been without power and water for two consecutive days. Without water and electricity, I can't cook in a restaurant, and eating every day is a problem. . . The local weather was still super hot, it was pitch black at night, there was no water to take a shower, no air conditioning to sleep at night, and prickly heat broke out all over my body. . The main thing is that I have two children with me. I can't eat, sleep, or play, let alone play. I haven't gone anywhere. These four days have been a complete suffering! <br> The reason for the negative review complaint is that at 10 a.m. on the 13th, the Central Meteorological Observatory has issued a yellow typhoon warning, a level 4 disaster response. The local government will start mobilizing the city to prevent typhoons at least on the 12th. With such a big movement, Tongcheng Travel Should I contact me in advance to ask about changing or canceling the itinerary? I didn't travel until the 14th. I had time to contact me, but I didn't. Even the text message sent to me on the night of the 13th stated that the weather was normal. <br>What’s even more annoying is that after contacting customer service, the reply was “We will not proactively call guests to request cancellation or change of itinerary.” . Damn it, even if there is a typhoon and tsunami ahead, you still want customers to come. Is this how you treat your customers or God? Do you even care about God’s life in order to make money? Is this how you are responsible for your customers? <br>Too bad! <br>The customer service also said that these were caused by the typhoon, which was irresistible and not caused by us. . . Yes, typhoons are force majeure, but unlike earthquakes, typhoons are predictable! Otherwise, the entire city would not have been warned for several days. . For such a big incident, you at least have the obligation to contact us first and inform us. But as for you, you did nothing and turned the tables and shied away all the responsibility. <br>Too **! <br>Be sure to leave negative reviews, negative reviews to the end! <br>Let everyone see how you treat your customers.

3646,3646,"Too deceitful, too fake, and too dishonest. Bad business, bad business. Just know how to make money. My wife and I booked a four-day trip during the Qingming Festival. In fact, we only went for two days and came back on the third day. Forget about airplanes, so-so. It started to look good, and I was contacted about the time to set off. I took a flight from Shanghai to Xiamen in the middle of the night. I arrived at 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. The hotel I booked was, oh no, it was an inn. It was a deceptive private room. They actually said it was full and gave me another hotel. The walls were shabby and shabby. , there was no remote control for the air conditioner, the lights were broken and wouldn’t work, it was humid and remote, and we were left on the roadside after getting off the plane. It's like turning in and out of a mountain path. I couldn't find customer service when I called them, and no one answered the phone number I left after texting their customer service, and I didn't even respond to phone calls. It's really you. I didn't sleep well one night and complained the next day. The result was a perfunctory comment about the poor customer service satisfaction. If I knew it was not good, I would quickly find a way to solve it. I don't feel any pain in my back when I stand. It happened that the tour guide was leading the tour on the first day, and my wife and I were calling your ** phone number to play JB! A day was wasted. The good mood of going out to relax and have fun is in this Qingming Festival. What a mess! Another night of humid accommodation followed, and the air conditioner kept blowing cold wind. It was freezing and I didn't sleep well. What about the dedicated customer service you promised? Will you call me back? Are you so blind that you can't see the call? ? Just know how to shirk responsibility. I signed the contract with you on the same journey. You arranged the itinerary for me. What supplier and hotel owner can I find to replace it? What do they know? moron! The next day is free travel, well, this is a happy holiday trip. It’s so exciting! ! Also, I have to fly back at 7 o'clock in the morning on the third day, and you don't give me any information. Where is the pick-up and drop-off that I agreed on? I still need to call and ask in person. Again, the customer service couldn't get through and I couldn't make a complaint before I asked. Do you just complain about the awesome phone calls? It didn’t solve my problem immediately! Apparently customer service just won't answer my calls. My wife still had a cold, and she had a fever and went to the hospital to have her blood drawn. I was in a bad mood when I came back. I have been in contact for four days, but different people have given me nonsense reasons and refused to solve the problem for me. Okay, then I said I had no choice but to go to 315. In the end, I wasn’t even afraid of 315. What an awesome company! Still thinking of using 100 or 300 to shut me up. **I accept my grievance and give you a hundred, can you shut up? Also, this is the first time I submitted an order. There was a problem with your own phone system and I couldn't get in, so I didn't pay. The customer service called me the next day and actually said that I had affected your Datong process. Wow, wow, what an awesome company. It turns out that customers are not God, they are causing you trouble. Have you ever thought about my emotional loss expenses, phone bills, medical expenses, accommodation expenses, travel expenses, mental loss expenses, this expense and that?

3647,3647,"When we arrived at the airport, there was a pick-up and drop-off service. This was good. You didn’t have to worry about it. Then I had to explain the accommodation. I didn’t explain it because it was too late on the first day. The room I stayed in was simply the worst I have ever stayed in. The quilt and pillows in the room are not clean. The room is small and pitiful. There is no shampoo or shower gel, and there is no hair dryer after washing your hair. The bathroom only has three or four toothbrushes, bath towels, and showerheads that are broken and not clean. I think The space to organize things was very small. Since I stayed very late on the first night, I had to get up at 7 o'clock the next day and didn't have time to meet up at 8:50. I still stayed in this miserable room the next day. Come on, the room was not tidied when I came back at night. It was still the same after I left, and no one cleaned it. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I went to the front desk and talked about it, and they changed the room on the third day. Oh my god, The gap is huge, it is so different. Not to mention the size, the environment is completely different. There is also a bathtub, but there was a problem with the water when I first got into it. It was very inconvenient to take a bath. The room felt very comfortable all of a sudden. I I want to ask why the gap is so big? Can anyone give me an explanation? I think two days in Xiamen is enough. The tour guide took us to Gulangyu Island on the first day. It was very hot and tiring. However, the food in Gulangyu Island is cheap and delicious. If you want to buy something, buy it on the island. Things on Zhongshan Road are expensive. It’s not that good. There are only a few small alleys in Zengcuo’an, which are just for food. Let’s take a look at the excitement. It’s suitable to rent an electric car in the evening on Huandao Road. It’s very comfortable and you can go to the beach to enjoy the breeze. Children should pay attention to safety. You can actually enter Xiamen University from the opposite side of the fort, but it is also restricted to people. If you want to see Furong Tunnel, just walk up the road and turn left and then right to see it. I went from Putuo Temple at that time. On the other hand, I took the wrong path and took too many wrong turns. It was really tiring and hot to climb up to Putuo Temple, and I am still in pain.

But every time I called, it was from a different customer service person, and each time I was transferred from one department to another. Every time I called, the answer was different, or they asked me to wait, and they would call me back half an hour later. If he didn't reply, I had to call him again. He went back and forth from 10:30 am to 5:00 pm without getting an accurate answer. This is not the first time your customer service team has encountered this kind of problem.

It's computer voice that doesn't solve the problem 24 hours a day. Also, my Tongcheng Tour offers a 50% discount for spending over RMB 2,500 on domestic travel. Why don’t you give me a discount? The merchant has no integrity. There are also 2 people who offered an instant discount of 100 yuan for adults, but they didn’t give me the discount or they only agreed to the discount after I asked for it myself. I haven’t seen it yet and I don’t know if I can return it. When we came back, we made an appointment to take us to the airport at 7.20, but we didn't show up at that time.

I couldn’t go because of the air traffic closure, so I went to other places to look around and it was just normal.

Everyone, please listen to what I said in detail about my coming. I signed up for a five-diamond itinerary. As a result, after arriving in Xiamen, I was assigned a four-diamond team! The first thing is to go to Gulangyu Island the next day. At 6 o'clock, I took the old and the young (there was a 60-year-old woman and an 11-year-old and a 3-year-old daughter) to wait for my 4-Diamond teammates at the hotel door. I live on the island, and the other friends are going back to Xiamen that day. It's an urban area, so you have to get up early and get on your way. Otherwise, it will be too late! Because I got up early, my 3-year-old daughter didn't get enough sleep. She was so tired when we visited the island! I fell asleep, so it was hard for me to appreciate some places. We stayed in a five-star hotel, and the breakfast for 2 people at 140 yuan per person turned into 2 small apples and 6 apples in the palm of a 3-year-old girl's hand. Almost the same size as a loaf of bread! Do you think we can eat enough for such a small breakfast? The worse they eat and the worse their mental state, do you think the elderly and children can still have the energy to play? The second thing: On the third day, we returned to the city attractions from the island. Because we were the only family living on the island, I had to drag the elderly, children and luggage by myself to the pier to queue up to buy tickets and take the boat back to the city. , and then take a taxi to the scenic spot to remit it! And it turned out that we arrived first (we followed the timetable provided by the tour guide), so the old man and the child and I waited for a full 20 minutes under the scorching sun. Because they were exposed to the scorching sun for a long time, my mother-in-law and daughter had no energy to visit the attractions! They found a cool place to wait for us to come back from our trip! Because there were elderly people and children, I spent a lot of money to find an easier route. The result was the opposite! I wanted the elderly and children to have a relaxing and enjoyable trip, but they ended up suffering! Might as well travel freely! Little money, good food, good housing, and good fun! Moreover, I reported the situation to the people on the same journey and they kept dealing with me. They didn’t give me an explanation for 5 days! I would like to suggest that friends who want to book the same trip, change a hotel, or travel independently, it will be more comfortable than the same trip! And also eat well, play well, and live well! What a disappointment!",Negative
3667,3667,"Can I say it's very, very bad? The three-day tour we signed up for had no itinerary on the first day and was told to depart at 7:40 on the second day. However, it was delayed until 8:20 before we detoured from the first hotel to the second one. We picked up people from the third and fourth hotels and set off in a group. It was already 10:30 after we picked up all the people and arrived at the pier to take the boat out. When we arrived at Gulangyu Island, we had a quick walk and included an hour and a half of free time to eat and the day ended at 4pm. It’s already past nine o’clock on the third day of the trip. The people from the first hotel haven’t arrived yet. The day before, I told the tour guide that we should leave early. The tour guide didn’t reply to the text message and refused to answer. We have to go to the second hotel and the third hotel to pick up the people. , I need to add that the fourth hotel is also located on Gulangyu Island. What time can I get to the scenic spot? ? ? When I arrived in Xiamen, did I come to the hotel and wait for someone? ? ? This kind of group tour is really not flattering. What is the difference between this and an 80-year-old man's sunset? ? ? I am really disappointed with Tongcheng. . . It was extremely disappointing. Apart from a decent stay and two breakfasts at the hotel, the two of us spent more than 4,500 on our three-day trip. We had to pay for everything else by ourselves. I really didn’t realize the low price and high quality of Tongcheng. . .",Negative
3668,3668,"I originally believed in this trip. I understand how the platform makes money, and I also understand when arranging a flight at night. If you arrange a flight at night, you will arrange for an evening pick-up. At night, the couple went to the airport and waited for an hour or two, and all the people who picked up the airport were called. No one answered the phone, and the emergency contact finally said that they had forgotten this order. Did you forget it after dinner? All the random comments are just bragging! Stop believing these crap! Everyone with a good attitude, you are Gods, you are so tough in your speech! There is still an itinerary, so just say four days is enough, but if you insist on five days, the couple will arrive at the hotel at three o'clock on the first night, go to bed at four o'clock, and get up at five thirty in the morning! No one asked me about it on the last day, so I just waited for the flight by myself. It was after 9 o'clock at night and it was late until 12 o'clock! I don’t blame you for this. Why don’t you arrange for the old couple to hang out in the morning? I will still be free from now on. The only time I believe in you is also the last time I believe in you! It’s too deceptive!",Negative
3669,3669,"It was said that it was four days, but it was actually only two days. The flight at 10 o'clock on the first day took two hours and asked us to arrive at the airport two hours early. We waited at the airport for four hours. The first day was over, and we went to Gulangyu Island the next day. We waited in line for an hour to take the boat, and it was raining. There is no place to play on the legendary Gulangyu Island. I don’t know why we were arranged to stay on the island. I thought we would still play on the island the next day, but the tour guide sent a message saying that We had to walk a long way early the next morning to buy ferry tickets and then return to Xiamen city. The adults were fine, but I also have two children. I was very tired from walking on the first day. The children couldn't get up in the morning, so You have to walk on your own and don’t have breakfast. Breakfast in the hotel costs RMB 90 per person. Unfortunately, I can’t afford such an expensive meal so I didn’t eat it. I can only blame my own spending power. The food on the island is not as expensive as usual. A plate of shredded potatoes costs RMB 35. .Okay, let’s eat. Adults can make do with it. Children can’t. We can only eat. The next day we went to a small temple and gave us half an hour to go shopping by ourselves. In the afternoon, we went on a sailboat for 150 yuan and drifted on the sea. It is said that you can see Taiwan's Golden Gate. Unfortunately, I have poor eyesight and didn't see anything. I just saw sailboats floating in the sea. After taking the boat, I went to the beach to play. The tour guide only gave me half an hour and didn't even tell me. We got off the bus halfway to the beach and walked there on our own. I would like to ask what we can do on the beach for half an hour without the 20 minutes of walking back and forth. Should I just take my children to see the sea and then turn back immediately? I didn’t even ask for the beach toys that I was promised for free. After asking a few times, I had no choice but to buy them myself. As everyone knows, the prices of things in tourist areas are surprisingly expensive. A certain store sells beach shovels for more than ten yuan. I have two children there. It cost 120. We missed the time and didn’t get on the bus. The tour guide asked us to take a taxi back and he would reimburse us. I thought it was okay and we could just play for a while. But the reimbursed person was nowhere to be seen, and the day passed like this. In the evening, the tour guide sent us a message saying that someone would pick us up at the airport at 10.30 the next day. As a result, the plane was delayed again and we had to wait for two hours. It was really frustrating. This is what two adults and two children spent more than 9,000 on a trip to Xiamen. During the trip, the tour guide told us that all the money we spent was on flights and accommodation. The total tickets for all our activities did not exceed 100 yuan. There are still many interesting places in Xiamen that we were not taken to. I would like to ask why I signed up. If I didn’t make it clear at the time, could it be that I went on the trip just to enjoy myself and stay in a five-star hotel? Besides, you only gave us a legendary five-star hotel. I can only express my disappointment for this four-day trip. , I am not disappointed with the city of Xiamen. I am very disappointed with Tongcheng. This is how you cheat customers. Of course, this is my first time traveling with you and it will also be my last.",Negative

They only said that they would get a refund so that they could buy the air tickets themselves, and they also said that they would make up a little bit of the difference in price when they repurchase the air tickets! I had to change airports to change my air tickets. Originally it only took half an hour to get home, but now it took me two and a half hours to get home. It was already early in the morning! After negotiation, they refused to reimburse the fare home. The customer service staff even said that even if you call the consumer agreement phone number, it will be useless!

A family of three-day tourists, because their trip ended successfully, and my five-day trip also ended here. I don’t know why we spent an extra night in a five-star hotel.

The time and place were originally stated in the tour notice before departure at 7:30, but surprisingly we didn’t leave Xiamen city until after 9 o’clock. There was also a problem with the vehicle arrangement, or there was no pick-up and drop-off arranged. The delivery and return arrangements were repeated on the last day. I was already on the plane, and the driver contacted me and said he would pick me up at the hotel. All in all, the experience was not good. <br>I also joined 100 Travel Club for my future travels, but my first experience was very bad.

We signed up for their tour at the time she said, but it turned out to be a lie. We stayed in a three-star hotel for the five days, and it was completely useless. No local characteristics. We made several phone calls and sent emails, saying they would resolve it immediately. However, after we had finished our trip, the matter still fell into the dust, with no news at all, not even an apology. We were very angry. We weren't as active as when we started urging us to pay the money. They called us one after another to urge us to pay. They told us that if it was late, we wouldn't be able to make a reservation. Once we paid, they didn't care about anything. If Tongcheng hires such a person, then there is no supervisory department to control it? Besides, we just got off the plane and there was no so-called pick-up. Only after calling did we find out that they had completely mistaken the plane we were going to and from. We waited at the airport for a long time before the driver came. The driver was nice. He came here after we were eating and heard us put down our bowls and chopsticks. But you, the person in charge of the same trip, are really irresponsible and even made mistakes in the itinerary of the passengers? The driver was sent the wrong pick-up itinerary.

It did not have the relaxing effect as expected. First of all, the staff were not notified about the accommodation arrangements the day before departure. I only learned about it when I asked about it. When we arrived in Xiamen, we were picked up by a van. The air-conditioning effect was really bad. We were sweating all the way. We were sent to the hotel. After about 20 minutes, the hotel front desk informed us that we would not check in at their hotel that day (the staff told us that we were all in Xiamen city).

The weather in Xiamen is very hot and the tour guide is also very hard. What I am dissatisfied with is the tour guide’s balance problem. This is also the reason why I am dissatisfied with this tour. The tour is very messy and almost everyone’s itinerary is different. , so all you have to do is make two decisions. First, if you don’t have this attraction, choose to buy tickets to go in and visit it with people who have this itinerary. Second, wait at the meeting point for people who have this itinerary to finish visiting. This is a waste of time and money. Energy and money, such a trip is also very tight. The tour guide (the tour guide has not introduced himself so far, so I don’t know the tour guide’s last name). The tour guide’s role in the itinerary is only to buy tickets, contact transportation, plan the itinerary, and explain the scenic spots. Don't even think about it. It is precisely because the group formation is very messy, the tour guide is very tired, and the service is not very refined. The whole service is perfunctory and impetuous. For the itinerary, take less and more, save the itinerary as much as possible. This itinerary also makes you think about giving it up. When you signed up for the group, you didn’t notice that there was a free Gulangyu headset rental fee. The tour guide didn’t remind us that we had it. We still paid the fee. The itinerary in the group is uneven. This is a Big question! Then, the weather was hot, so the whole group went to Gulangyu Island and walked endlessly from Neicuoao Pier to Longtou Road. The walking was very tiring and there was very little rest time. Many people in the group were exhausted. When they arrived at Longtou Road, the tour guide strongly recommended We were too tired to eat at a certain restaurant, so we ate there. In the afternoon, we still walked to the Lijiazhuang Souvenir Experience Center (the tour guide asked us to visit and rest there), which is equivalent to a specialty store. The tour guide also The salesperson was selling products together, and the pedometer recorded a one-day trip to Gulangyu Island of 13 kilometers. The sun was very strong and it was easy to suffer from heat stroke, and the tour guide did not show any concern. The trip on the third day was almost a waste, because we stayed in Gulangyu Island on the second day, and the tour guide picked us up at the pier on the third day (this needs to be affirmed, the tour guide was very punctual). After receiving us, we arrived in Xiamen, and the tour guide asked us to go in one direction. , the person who came back was gone, and they didn’t tell us who was there, so we waited in the heat.

I asked customer service again about when the free Starbucks coffee would be given to me. The customer service replied that the local tour guide would give it to me after arriving in Xiamen. I waited for a few days and I will go home tomorrow. I didn’t see the free Starbucks coffee. Could you tell me when Where is the Starbucks I was told to deliver? The plane arrived half an hour late, and it was already past one o'clock when we arrived at the hotel. When I communicated with the hotel front desk about the room, there was a discrepancy. The hotel front desk asked me to check with the customer service before booking a room. OK, I asked the customer service, and the customer service only responded to my message half an hour later. Sister, it's past one o'clock. We, a family of three, have not eaten lunch and are standing in the lobby waiting for your reply. It took more than half an hour before you responded to your message. How can I give you a good review? My daughter is 12 years old and 160cm tall. The customer service said at the time that she would be charged as an adult. I said yes. But when I came to the hotel, they said it was an extra bed in a double room. Then when I paid, why didn't they tell me that I only had to pay for the extra bed? ? Regarding check-in, there were two rooms, a double room on the first day, and then the next day they contacted me and said that the double room was booked, and asked me if I would mind changing to another room. I thought that we were all in the same hotel anyway, which one would I stay in? The room didn't matter, but the front desk called me again today and said that ** would only book me until today. I have to check out today, and the room has already been occupied by someone else. Am I here to stay in the hotel or do I come to change rooms every day?",Negative

Then we were not arranged to sit on the sailing boat. We were not taken to any scenic spots on Gulangyu Island. , and then we agreed to visit Xiamen University and didn’t take us to visit, so we didn’t say anything anymore. When I came back, I agreed that the master would take me to the airport, but the master called me at the last minute and said that he couldn’t come and asked me to do it myself. Then I almost missed the plane. I was not given any compensation for not being able to pick up the plane. It was so ****. I decided to go to court and sue this ****. If Tongcheng doesn’t give me a reasonable explanation, I will file a complaint against you.",Negative

He waited for an hour. After receiving it, we took a detour to see the tourists off. Our flight arrived at 8:55, and it was almost 11 o'clock when we got back to the hotel! Going to Gulangyu Island the next day was even more nonsense. The tour guide contacted me in advance and told me to leave before 7:30 in the morning. The two of us were punctual the whole time, complaining about unqualified tourists who only think about themselves. One moment, one is late on the bus, and the other is lost. Sorry, the tour guide has poor coordination skills and just wastes time waiting for people to take roll call. It was already 11 o'clock when we arrived on the island. The tour guide was rushing for time and talked about useless things, all for the sake of selling things. To be honest, I didn’t see anything. It only took an hour to go shopping and eat in Xinsihai.",Negative
3698,3698,"This is the first time I have booked a trip online with Tongcheng, but I am not very satisfied. On this trip to Xiamen, I was quite satisfied with the airport pick-up service and hotel accommodation. I didn’t have to wait for a long time to pick up the airport, and the driver was able to pick up and drop off the hotel as soon as possible. I stayed in the Haichang Hualuxe Hotel in the city, and the hotel environment was great. The service is quite satisfactory, and the hotel's breakfast is also very rich. You can try it out if you go there in the future. However, I was not very satisfied with the ground pick-up service and itinerary arrangement of this trip. Yunshuiyao was okay on the first day. It was already noon when we arrived at the destination. On the way there, we stopped at a resting place for more than half an hour. It was a specialty store and there was no compulsory shopping. However, I felt that I wasted time. I stopped at three o'clock in the afternoon. After setting off and returning, the actual tour time was relatively short; the next day was the main destination of this trip, Gulangyu Island, but the tour time was too tight and the trip ended too early. When we arrived at the island in the morning, it was almost 11 o'clock, and it was 3 o'clock in the afternoon. The day's trip was over. I arrived at one destination, and before I had time to appreciate it, I was already rushing to the next destination. I originally planned to go to Sunlight Rock, but the tour guide didn't recommend it, which made my wife regret it after she came back. On the third day of the itinerary, we originally cycled in both Zengcuo'an and Huandao Road, so the tour guide dropped us off at Zengcuo'an, leaving us with a little more than an hour, and combined the two itineraries into one. Time, how can we cycle Zengcuo'an and Huandao Road at the same time? As a result, I spent more time in Putuo Temple in the afternoon. This place does not require much time at all. Return by yourself the next day. At this point, the five-day tour is over, and the actual valid time is only three days. travel. Usually I am more willing to choose Tongcheng when traveling, but I hope that Tongcheng will be careful in choosing third parties in the future.",Negative
3699,3699,"This trip is scheduled for five days because I want to roam around the romantic city of Xiamen. There should be no problem with the same trip arrangement, but the evaluation of the tour guide on the same trip is very poor 👎🏻. The whole arrangement is to pick up the tour guide to explain and introduce Xiamen. I didn’t mention the local charming town of Tulou in Gulangyu Island. The Tulou tour guide the next day was the same. I had no choice but to fish in troubled waters in Tulou and followed other tour guides to listen carefully to the legends and magic of Tulou. The last stop in Zuitulou was to taste tea at the tour guide’s house. The seven people in our group may not have purchased any tea, but I think everyone should know the tour guide’s attitude. When we went to Gulangyu Island, seven of us and three of us were feeling unwell that day. The tour guide didn’t even care to tell us where to go to the pharmacy or what local food we should pay attention to. On the third day of the itinerary, there was a little girl who was really uncomfortable. She took a taxi back to the hotel at ten o'clock in the morning, and the tour guide didn't care to ask what was going on! Speechless... I have traveled on Tongcheng.com many times and I never expected to meet these two tour guides this time. I have no interest at all! Almost the three days of itinerary passed by in silence. So disappointing. Of course, I would like to strongly recommend and praise the driver 0628 who picked up the plane on the day. This person was very enthusiastic and his short pick-up time could almost replace the tour guide's work. He answered all questions and introduced many local scenery and snacks! I really want him to be there on the second day, third day and fourth day! The details of this master are very touching and kind-hearted. Finally, I just want to say that I hope that friends who will travel to Xiamen will never encounter the above two tour guides, which is very disappointing!",Negative

When they came back, they said they would never go on a group trip again. When they went there, the flight was delayed by nearly 4 hours. I came back more than 6 hours late, the accommodation conditions were poor, there was construction all night around the hotel, and the tour guide was perfunctory... On the first day, I offered to change the hotel for a price difference, and said it was okay. On the second day, he said that the trip had already started and he couldn't change. Then I asked him to see if I could change rooms, but he replied that the hotel rooms were full and I couldn't change them. Then I heard nothing from him. When I asked him to give a negative review, he showed up again, insisting that I shouldn't give a negative review. It will affect the salary and bonus, and he doesn't think about the return without effort. If you want to have a high salary and bonus, you must do your job well. It is indeed not easy to meet everyone's requirements, but you only need to have a correct attitude. , let everyone know that you are working hard and that you are really doing things for the customers you serve. I think it will be a completely different result. Of course, my travel consultant is still good, very dedicated, and very patient in answering questions.

The trip was canceled due to external factors. There is no good substitute, and it’s a fool. 4. Most of the places we visit are free. They are too commercialized and have no value for visiting.

The next day, it took more than three hours to arrive at Yunshuiyao. The eight dishes and one soup were all vegetarian and had no taste at all. They told us that this was a special dish that the locals eat every day. They also said that there was wild boar meat, but there was no such thing. In the evening Changed hotel again. On the third day, ① the originally promised breakfast was ruined. The reason was that the tour guide booked a very early ticket in a rush for the trip, leaving us without breakfast. After our feedback, the solution was solved. ②The tour guide did not wait for us to check out at the hotel, so we had to take a taxi to the pier [the cost of 60 was not reimbursed]. On Gulangyu Island, he took us to a tour of free places, and changed hotels again in the evening. On the fourth day, it rained and I was in a hurry to catch up on the trip. Each trip took less than an hour [including meal time]. Most of the time was spent in the car, and it ended very early, and changed again in the evening. Got to the hotel. The fifth day, free travel. On the sixth day, I changed hotels again in the evening. Today is the seventh day, the last day of the journey. ** did not help us make an appointment with the driver in advance. After all, it is difficult to make an appointment so early. We had to make an appointment in advance, which made us almost miss the 6:50 flight. During the entire trip, we were dragging our luggage here and there, changing hotels every day, and our clothes couldn't be washed or dried. The tour guide named Li on the third and fourth days had a black face the whole time. The promised free flow of mineral water was only provided at our request, and the promised free-flowing mineral water and LED electric fans on the Huandao Road were not provided. After asking a few more questions, the store guide became impatient. We didn't stay in any of the three hotels on the tour notice.

I had to figure out how to book a room on my own. I called the emergency contact and they arranged two single rooms for me.

We had to go to the fort by ourselves, and we had to carry all our luggage with us. I was really impressed. We made an appointment at 8 o'clock, but the tour guide didn't arrive until 9 o'clock. We only had 40 minutes to go to Gulangyu Island. When we arrived, we started to crowded with people dragging our luggage. After the sun set, the temperature dropped. We had no itinerary and we were not allowed to go to the hotel. We had to wait for others to visit other attractions. <br><br>If you leave the island on your own on the 3rd, you will have to pay 18 yuan for a boat ticket per person.

We called the tour guide and told him that there was no car and asked us to complain. He called the emergency contact person and said that we could come.

No one came to tell us that the flight was at 9:25 pm on June 10th. The result: I didn’t get on the plane until the early morning of June 11, and it was already five o’clock by nine o’clock. It's also late to come back. The driver is even worse. Never go to someone who rents or cooperates with you. Especially for drivers in Northeast China, although it is a tourist city, it is certain to make money. On such a hot day, the air conditioner is not turned on. Damn it. I'll turn on the hot air for you. We rented a car and it cost 450 per day. They don’t want to take you there either. Inexplicably taking us places we didn't ask to go. I spent more than a thousand for no reason. I said it was not fun and just turned on the hot air. My flight back was also delayed, and no one contacted me at all. A long time wasted in vain. As long as you don't follow the driver's route and don't pay enough, you'll be embarrassed the whole time. We come out to travel and have fun. There's no need to be upset, we want to buy fruit, don't take us there. I won’t come to Sanya again anyway. Very bad impact.",Negative

I had great hopes before I went there. , I thought we must have lived well, but I didn’t expect that there are actually several Sheratons in Sanya. The one we stayed in was in the suburbs, close to the sea, and there was no listing at all. I thought it was only up to Samsung standards at most, and it was inconvenient to buy food. Moreover, the Sheraton was particularly hygienic. It's bad. I dare not look at the dirty carpet. I feel very uncomfortable. I just stayed here for a few days. It's not 60 square meters.

In addition, the airport pick-up provided by the hotel was picked up by a small car, not a bus, and the car was not very good. The pick-up was not good, but the drop-off bus was not bad.

3734,3734,"Complaining about the sudden drop in tour fees on Tongcheng Travel.com, I booked a tour from Beijing to Sanya from January 17 to 22, 2018 on January 4, 2018. The tour fee was 4,355 yuan for four people. Today, January 13, 2018, I found that the tour fee had dropped to 3,716 yuan, a price difference of 649 yuan. The difference between the four people is nearly 2,600 yuan. I communicated with the customer service phone, and the website issued a dynamic ticket. The price difference was due to the price difference of the ticket. In my opinion, first of all, the website does not provide a detailed explanation of dynamic ticket issuance, which leads me to think that as long as the ID number is correct, it is not necessary to bear the economic losses of fare fluctuations. Second, the air ticket was booked from the airline on the website, not by me. If I had booked it myself, I would be responsible for the financial losses. But considering the website booking of air tickets, they need to bear the responsibility, rather than placing all the responsibility on the consumers. Third, I think this evasive behavior has seriously damaged the image of Tongcheng Travel Network. Here, I would like to ask Tongcheng Travel Network to face up to this problem, and at the same time ask the tourism supervision department to urge Tongcheng Travel Network to compensate consumers for relevant economic losses.",Negative

It is better to visit this place in winter. Let’s talk about things to do. There are just these scenic spots that everyone knows. There is not much to say. Going to places where you spend money will always make you stay for a long time. For a long time, I introduced you all kinds of things and tried every means to make you spend money. Everything was very expensive. The biggest failure was the tour guide named Wang Zhequn. From the first day when he introduced the scenic spots in the car, he had an expression of unwillingness. With a bit of dedicated enthusiasm, he always looked out the window when introducing scenic spots. You can only see his smile when everyone is making purchases. Because he earns a commission, no one in the entire group of ten people had a good time with him. He only gave a brief introduction to the scenic spots. I solved the problem immediately. I guess some people didn’t go to the several consumption projects he recommended. He didn’t earn any commission. I guess he just wanted to make you happy if you don’t make me happy. This kind of tour guide has tainted us. The group’s impression of Sanya was that even the driver scolded him behind his back. The driver spoke more straightforwardly and told us that he had not been on time when picking up tour guides in the past few days and asked the driver to wait for him. The driver said that we encountered such a tour guide We have been unlucky for eight lifetimes, and he himself has been unlucky for five lifetimes. After everyone came down from Wuzhizhou Island, we waited for the tour guide for more than 20 minutes before he came down. After the agreed time, he didn't even apologize. To be honest, on the last day, the tour guide Wang Zhequn brought us a form and asked us to write down our opinions on the tour guide and the itinerary. Haha, who did we show our opinions to? Why didn't he write it out and hand it in? If we have any opinions, we will still do it. Can I write it out for you to see? In the end, almost no one wrote an opinion.

The hotel is located in the suburbs and there is nothing around. It feels very inconvenient to travel without a car while living here. The hotel service is pretty good. Eat: I had a buffet breakfast at the hotel in the morning. The variety was good. It was the best food service among the days... because the group meal was getting worse day by day. Play: The most unsatisfactory part was that the whole trip was Sanya didn’t leave much of an impression, because basically I just walked into the scenic area and came out. The first day was Betel Valley and Yalong Bay. Only in Betel Valley there were tour guides from the scenic area who introduced some Li and Miao culture; Zhizhou Island is just a day spent on the island. If you don’t participate in the paid programs on the island, you basically just go to the island to see the sea view. On the third day, you go to the Big and Small Cave Sky and Tianya Haijiao. In fact, you basically just go to the island to see the sea view. , nothing new. In the itinerary, each scenic spot only includes tickets. However, due to the environmental factors of the scenic spot, basically each scenic spot requires the purchase of an additional sightseeing car as a means of transportation, and the price ranges from 35 to 150. What is more valuable on the last day is that after finishing the ** trip, our group of 6 decided to go to Nanshan together. In fact, this scenic spot is quite sightseeing, but it is not on the same route. We finished the tour at noon After the same route, we were all exhausted. In Nanshan, we only spent a little longer at Nanhai Guanyin. The rest we just took the sightseeing car and passed by... Based on the above situation, I do not recommend that newcomers choose this route. The route is not very interesting... The most dissatisfying thing about this trip is that there was no tour guide throughout the whole journey. There was only one driver taking 6 people to various scenic spots. After taking us into the scenic spot, there was no one to take us... In this situation, I don’t know what the point of me signing up for a group tour, and the only driver, on the first day of the trip, actively promoted other paid items for us, which made people feel quite bad.

My home is Those who are picked up earliest in the morning and dropped off at the latest in the evening will spend 2 hours more on the road every day than those who are picked up late and dropped off early. The time cost of 2 hours is too high, so it is recommended that even if you travel in a group, it is best to choose a hotel with only one or two And not far apart. But the group members on this tour are more time-conscious and don’t have to waste time waiting for others, which is good. Speaking of scenic spots, you can visit more scenic spots with a group tour without having to worry about transportation and meals. However, it is not leisurely and in-depth enough, and the food is mediocre. If you have enough time, it is recommended to travel independently. You can stay where you like for a longer time. For example, on Wuzhizhou Island, my tour guide Ah Jing was already very good. He arranged for us to go out very early, so as to ensure that we didn’t have to wait in line for too long.

It probably means that we must book it with him, or we have to give him 80 yuan for the fare. Ask the tour guide about this hotel. Is there a sea nearby? She said it takes an hour by taxi. Later someone asked as I passed by and found out that the distance by taxi is only 10 yuan... Haha",Negative
3774,3774,"I was really disappointed with this tour. First, the default flight time is around 11pm. After 12pm, it will be counted as the next day. When I come back, it will be around 6am. I placed the order directly because I didn’t see it clearly. Later, I realized that it was like this. I wasted two days, the so-called 4 nights, and then I couldn't contact the customer immediately to change the ticket. I finally decided to change the ticket back, and paid the handling fee for a total of more than 700. Second, it was already past 2 a.m. when we arrived at the hotel that night, and we had to meet at 7 o'clock the next day. The hotel we stayed in was very bad, not even as good as seven days. It was small, dirty, and there were so many mosquitoes that I couldn’t sleep at all. I had to get up and gather to take a bus to Sanya. The drive took three hours. The Wuzhizhou Island I went to was okay, but it was just for consumption. It’s really high, mineral water costs 10 yuan and noodles cost about 60 yuan. . There is also a ticket for one of the attractions that you need to pay for yourself. If you don't go, the tour guide will be unhappy and say something very unpleasant, saying that basically everyone will go to this scenic spot, and he will be embarrassed if someone doesn't go. On the third and fourth days, we went to small attractions, and our stay was not long. We had to change hotels every day, and the only hotel in the Villa was better, right! ! There are also included meals! real. very poor. Feel it for yourself. Every scenic spot you visit will have things you need to pay for at your own expense. For example, they will tell you that it is a long way down the mountain and ask you to buy a ticket. the last point! ! It’s just a shopping spot! In the past, when I went shopping with a group, I would go and check it out on my own! I believe Tongcheng doesn’t dare to force those purchases! But this time in the rubber hall, you are forced to sit and listen to the lecture. The woman who lectures is super aggressive and yells at people not to use their mobile phones. See you soon! Not enough words. Anyway, bad",Negative
3775,3775,"This trip to Sanya was unsatisfactory. The flight was about 4 hours late. After arriving in Sanya, when we went to visit Wuzhizhou Island on the first day, the eight of us were divided into two groups. I didn’t know it. The family was separated and couldn’t take care of it. There was no tour guide to explain after we got to the island. I was on the island by myself. Wandering around. Later, after contacting customer service and communicating, the problem was solved. The tour guide did not communicate with us the next day, changed the tour route without authorization, and added places to visit. Yalong Bay, which was originally visited in the morning, was changed to after 4 pm, leaving no time for many activities. It is recommended to pay for the attractions at your own expense Projects and shopping. On the third day, while traveling, I deceived people at Nanshan scenic spots and tricked them into buying consecrated Buddha statues and zodiac pendants. The tour guide had no sense of time and made us wait for her for a long time. Sometimes she had a bad attitude when we talked to her. This trip to Sanya was a bit confusing. I was in a bad mood and did not follow the travel contract. Accommodation and breakfast are okay. Tongcheng's customer service is still good and deserves praise.",Negative

Six old people have to wait at the airport for more than 2 hours. The old people's clothes We didn’t have much to wear and it was so cold that we almost got sick.

I later called the customer service number and said that the dedicated customer service would get back to me in a while, but no one ever contacted me. After the consultation, I was not enthusiastic at all and ignored... Later, if I had any questions during the trip, I contacted him. The so-called exclusive customer service had deleted me... I couldn't be contacted. Who should I contact if there is any emergency during the trip? Is this what you call a service? Exclusive? In addition, for the same itinerary and flight, the hotel has airport pick-up and drop-off, so it’s strange that I didn’t have airport drop-off... The customer service number is 12540, which is too bad... I will never choose the same trip again in the future, so **",Negative

It took off at 9:40 a.m. on the 27th. I got off the plane at around 12 noon and contacted customer service. (Because the whole group had already traveled that day) no one was there to pick up the plane in an unfamiliar place. The customer service’s answer was infuriating. (Because of the weather, (Irresistible, sorry) I made more than a dozen calls at Meilan Airport and the three sentences I listened to the most were these three. They gave us two solutions. First, buy a train ticket from Haikou to Sanya out of your own pocket, and then take a taxi to the hotel. The cost Conceited, waiting for the next day's trip. Second, if we change the ticket and complete the entire trip, we will have to bear the fare of 200 yuan per person. {We are unable to agree due to our vacation). I would like to ask Tongcheng: Are we traveling in a group or traveling independently? Is this how you serve your guests? Finally, I contacted our tour guide (Hainan Airlines International Travel Yang Chuntao) and he took the initiative to help us pick us up and take us to the hotel, so that we could follow the whole group in time to participate in the second day's itinerary. In the next three days, the tour guide Tao Ge helped us The enthusiastic service and detailed introduction of local cultural attractions made our shadows of the previous day disappear.

As a result, around 9:45 a.m. the next day, the driver called me and said he couldn't arrive at 10 a.m. because there was a traffic jam. Does the driver not consider the time spent in traffic jams when he goes out? He told me that he would definitely arrive within 20 minutes, but I waited at the hotel door until 10:20! As a result, we didn’t have time to buy products from the airport’s online duty-free shop! 8.

Until the reservation was made, no one told me that I would change the hotel in case of special circumstances. As a result, my parents said that on the same day I went to Sanya and was told that there was no room at the Metropark Hotel, so I could only stay at the Shiba Hotel. It was said to be a hotel of the same level, but it turned out to be thousands of miles away. I asked the tour guide why there was no room, and he said that you had made a late reservation. I really... I'm speechless. If you book a group a few months in advance, there will be no room? Everyone else in the same group stayed at the Metropark Hotel. My parents took the bus to the Metropark Hotel 1 or 2 hours earlier than others every day to meet up with the group. I told my dad that my dad had a bad leg and could change with someone else. Come on, don’t go to such trouble, but there is no way to complain, no one has responded at all, and no explanation has been given so far. The complaints officer’s attitude is so bad that he directly hung up my complaint call. He started harassing me on the first day of the New Year, saying The Eighteen Hotel is very good. I said you originally promised me Metropark Hotel. Why did you suddenly change your mind? There is no solution. I asked them even if they want to verify the situation. Then you can call me after verifying it. But no. There is no solution to stop harassment. This year, these harassing calls have become extremely disgusting.

It would have been terrible if we hadn't arrived there in the middle of the night. People also get tired. Too lazy to complain. But some passengers complained. As a result, the complainant was able to stay in a good hotel for his last night. And the one we have no complaints about is still the alternative hotel. Isn't this too unfair? Go out and play for three days. But in fact, there were only two days to play. There is also a day that can be said to be almost all consumption. Overall, I am not satisfied with the itinerary. The accommodation conditions are not good either.",Negative

It is quite popular at night. It has its own swimming pool. The children refuse to go upstairs to sleep every time after playing. The leisure facilities are also quite good. It sounds good that it is a sea view room, but it is not. It is still a bit far from the seaside. There are no shops nearby. I don’t think it’s because of the new development. It’s fine.

We didn’t even know how to lead the way, so we took a lot of unnecessary steps back and forth! When we arrived at the scenic spots, we just played by ourselves without introducing them to us. We just hid in the shade by ourselves! Paradise Forest Park took us on a tour, but we were not taken to many attractions! This tour guide is the tour guide I am most dissatisfied with! Never seen anything like this! Not much to say, boring! It feels like some stupid travel companies can use such tour guides! If you are not familiar with the road conditions, ask the local people! She couldn't answer the questions I asked her! Hey, I’m really speechless! This hotel is great! Lakai Hotel, the service is good and the hotel environment is also good!

When I arrived at the hotel at 12 o'clock, I found out that it was the most basic one. They were told that they would need to add 200 yuan a night, which means it would cost 800 yuan to upgrade. I called the after-sales phone number and the complaint phone number, and waited in the lobby on the ground floor for three hours. The answer is to let us add money to upgrade ourselves! Then who misappropriated my 1,600 yuan hotel upgrade money? ? ? What I want to say is to travel happily. Such a good mood is due to consultant Wang Ren's negligence and incompetent work! After sales incompetence! This matter was not resolved even after three hours. In the end, it was Palme d'Or. They changed our room for us without saying a word. You can book this hotel when you come to Sanya in the future. The service is good and the most important thing is to consider the customers. I think tourists like this kind of service industry? ? In addition, the driver who picked up the car on the 17th was also pretty good. Actually, I have to give Wang Ren a bad review for his work! Tongcheng’s after-sales service also has bad reviews!

Don't think about it, I suggest you choose a high-rise building, the garden room is too smelly. The group basically gives one level. Sanya is still very suitable for vacation. The waves and beaches are very good. As for the dining, there is nothing delicious. The food in the hotel is much better than outside. The price seems to be quite high, but the portion and taste are awesome! There really isn’t much to do in the scenic spots, so if you want to relax, you might as well rent a yacht and go out to sea. The complimentary airport pick-up service... I don’t want to complain! Also, don’t listen to travel consultants’ scams. Don’t listen to travel consultants’ scams. Don’t listen to travel consultants’ scams. Say important things three times, and ask customer service directly if you have any questions.

It was so much fun to have fun, and there was also dining. The group told me that there was a meal arrangement, but since we were a family of three, we were allowed to dine by ourselves. The meal fee was refunded. The 30 yuan per person and child was half price, and we were refunded for the meal. 75 yuan. Think about it. We are in Sanya, a city that relies on tourism. When we signed up for a group breakfast at the hotel, we were told that it would cost 168 yuan per person because we wanted to add breakfast for the children. Although the actual price at the hotel was 80 yuan per person, but think about it. What can we eat for 75 yuan! So every time we dine by ourselves, we have to spend about 200 yuan, and seafood is much more expensive than ours in Shanghai.

3804,3804,"It's been three or four days since I came back. I'm just writing this review now because I want to evaluate my experience of this trip as objectively as possible. I still want to leave a negative review, because the beauty of the destination cannot cover up the shortcomings of the customer service on the same journey, and I would like to express my regret. Let me talk about it first. The single-family villa has a swimming pool. The hotel has a full schedule of various activities every day. It is also far from the city. It suits my quiet style. The parent-child activities are also good. The children play various games together and have a good time. of interaction. The restaurant also has a wide variety of Chinese and Western food, and there is also a meal delivery service. Basically, the front desk will try to satisfy you with any request you have, provided you have money, haha. Okay, now the complaint mode is on. Because I have children, I paid extra to upgrade to round-trip first class. This is why I gave the customer service a negative review. Let me explain in detail: I called the customer service and the feedback was that it was first class for outbound flights. There was not enough space in the cabin, so I said fine, I would reschedule the flight to the next day, but still failed to secure a seat, so I said forget it, let’s just take economy class. The fourth day of the return trip was not enough, so I said fine, just postpone the return trip for another day. It showed that there were tickets, 5,000 per person, 2,500 for children. So far, the customer service is perfect, just a little hit or miss. No rush, wait until I get on the plane. I found that there was only one person in the first class cabin. Of course, it is possible that the other seven people changed their tickets collectively. This is possible. At this time, I had no reason to blame the customer service, and then I upgraded myself, which cost 1,000 for a person and 500 for a child. When we arrived at the hotel, we had all kinds of food, fun, and a pleasant experience. Next, I will continue to complain. The day before my return trip, my wife wanted to go to the duty-free shop, so I called my dedicated customer service and wanted to change my booking to first class. Here, I would like to give Song Jing a thumbs up. It was already past 10 o'clock in the evening, but she still patiently helped me solve the problem. I can rate her service 4 points, which is good, but some processes are not very familiar to me. Then the feedback was that my colleagues said that there were not enough tickets left. When I thought that I was so unlucky, I searched for the tickets for the same trip and found that there were 2 first-class seats and 1 value-for-money business class seat. Here I It's a bit frustrating. Anyone who has flown in first class knows that the two tickets are actually the same, but there is a handling fee for business class changes. After I gave Song Jing feedback, she said she would help me deal with it during work hours tomorrow because it was indeed quite late, which I can understand. Then the next day, the feedback said that I need to call the airline myself. I thought it didn’t matter. It was just a phone call. But when I called the customer service, they said that I needed to call the two mobile phone numbers mentioned in the note to make the change. It’s not easy, so I continued to call. Song Jing contacted her and her colleague entered my phone number in the note, and then continued to call to change the booking. Then the feedback still didn't work, it had to be the number originally noted, and it also reminded that the change time was two hours before departure, and the time was tight. Helpless, continue to give feedback. In the end, the problem was solved without my involvement. I think you probably understand what I mean, right? Let me summarize: 1. The process is cumbersome and the experience is too bad. No matter how diligent you are, you can't cover up the wasted effort; 2. My expenses are artificially increased for no reason. Since there is a super value business, why don't you book it for me? Do you need a full-price ticket? Did you foresee that I would eventually change my ticket?

But as soon as we entered, there was a battery car, and we quickly reached the top of the mountain. After overlooking the panoramic view, the tour guide asked us to experience the 158 yuan adventure project at our own expense. Although the experience was good, we only visited one of the scenic spots in Yalong Bay. We asked to get off the bus for a tour, but the tour guide said that we would have to queue up, there were a lot of people, we would have to walk a long way, etc., so we were allowed to sit in a battery car and watch the whole journey. We came down from Yalong Bay and took us to Love Cube. This attraction is actually a free square where you can go to the beach to have a look and enjoy the breeze. The next day, we went to Wuzhizhou. Along the way, the tour guide told us how good the diving projects in Wuzhizhou were and we must try it. But we chose to take a battery car to travel around the island. Wuzhizhou is beautiful and very suitable for wedding photography. There is no lunch on the second day, so it is recommended to bring dry food and enough water if you go. Dinner is a seafood dinner at our own expense, but we’ll talk about it later. The third day is the end of the world and the big and small caves. As soon as we arrived at the scenic spot in the morning, the tour guide found us a so-called master in the scenic spot. The master started talking about Feng Shui metaphysics as soon as he entered the house, and he also secretly changed the concept and said that it was traditional culture. Serious nonsense. Sure enough, he finally took us to Tianzhiya Crystal Museum. We were given less than an hour to freely move around the scenic spot, and we had just arrived at the scenic spot in Tianya Haijiao and had to go back. Just took some random photos and forget it. The highlight was entering the so-called Crystal Hall exhibition hall, which took us more than an hour to explore by ourselves. It turned out that there was an aunt in the group who was in the jewelry industry and she said the crystals were fake. The Big and Small Cave Sky is also very good. It is a fully self-guided tour, because the tour guide disappeared after entering the scenic spot and agreeing on the gathering time. There was no group meal on the third night. All the journey ends here. Talking about group meals, our group meals include two lunches and one dinner. You can experience the taste by yourself, and it’s hard to describe how bad it tastes. Don't have expectations. Next, let’s talk about our own expenses. The tour guide charges 450 per person. The first day was the Crown of Beauty show. The whole thing was a lap dance. The seafood dinner the next day was pretty good. But the total of these two things, 450 yuan per person, is still not worth it. Finally, let’s talk about the tour guide. The little girl feels like she arranged her life and itinerary. As soon as you arrive at the scenic spot, find a scenic guide. There is no real tour guide duty at all. Self-funded projects are recommended along the way. For example, in Wuzhizhou, if we choose to dive at our own expense, we will not have time to see the scenery at all. As for Yalong Bay, we chose to explore at our own expense, so we didn’t have any sightseeing spots. Finally, overall, it is better to travel freely in Sanya in the future. The cost is about the same. Still going with a group~~~",Negative

3813,3813,"This trip was very unpleasant because I had been treated like a gold card member on my previous outbound trips.

After I inquired, an itinerary was reported to me. Because I was not at the company that day and was visiting clients outside, I couldn’t look carefully at the itinerary he provided me. Since I was not next to the computer, I told him all my requirements. Well, he He kept urging me. One moment he said that the room was gone, and the next moment the air ticket was about to be sold out. Then I told him to place the order first, and then gave me 10 minutes to pay.

The hotel was not bad, but the exhaust fan in the room was broken. The toilet smell in the room could not be discharged. It was 37 degrees and I didn’t dare to open the window.

3818,3818,"The five-day itinerary was later changed to Sanya Bay Queen Brown, which finally made up for the regrets of the previous two days. Let me talk about the hotel waiter first. I really wanted to curse because I had children, but I restrained myself. It was quite cold in those two days. The children had runny noses, so I asked about the drinks bar in the lobby. The waiter asked for a tissue, and he put his hand in to help me get it. Then he told me to go to the supermarket across the street to buy it. A tissue is worth a dime. Two hours later, my wife bought the child a hot drink at the beverage bar. , it comes in a plastic cup, you either have a paper cup or a glass cup. I wonder if plastic cups have bisphenol A when exposed to high temperatures. Such service attitude and professionalism. Is there a lack of training? The food in the hotel is really bad. You will know after you go to see it. In fact, the accommodation environment and catering can be handled by customer service. The service experience is too bad, so I decided to change hotels midway. Tongcheng's full-time customer service said that they could not help me on the day of the annual meeting. The service asked me to call the company and an employee would handle it. I think I was eager to apply for payment to help you improve performance. Now I will just shirk the problem at the annual meeting. I haven't called the customer to inquire about the situation for a few days. It's too philistine. Well, Tongcheng refused to change it for me at that time. After insisting on my request, I agreed that I could get a refund for the remaining two days and the room rate for the other day could not be refunded. Then my wife went to negotiate directly with the hotel room department, and the hotel refunded her money starting at 8:30 in the morning.

After calling and asking the driver, the driver said he should be at the hotel at least at 1:50. I want to ask if this pick-up and drop-off service is reliable. Is the drop-off service really good? I can't complain about the whole independent trip. Except for the hotel, there is no satisfactory flight or extra money to change the flight. The result is a delay and waste my two days. The flight is delayed. I can't help it. I also understand that the pick-up and drop-off is so bad. It is really unbearable. In the end, I took the reliable taxi myself.",Negative
3820,3820,"I changed the time of my outbound and return tickets myself, and Hainan Airlines was pretty good. Arranging free airport pick-up is a trap!

The guy who picked us up at the airport took us from the airport to the hotel. It only takes 30 minutes to travel, but it took two and a half hours! ! ! I have specifically inquired about the airport pick-up service before, and Tongcheng's answer was that it will be picked up from a hotel or a nearby hotel. The actual answer is: for one flight or even several flights, they will arrange a bus and then transfer it to a minibus to pick up the passengers together. To various hotels in Sanya City! No wonder it took us longer to get back to the hotel than on the plane! ! ! We landed at around 5pm, so we didn’t have dinner until 8pm! ! It’s not that I force you to take it. Our own Didi or taxi only costs a few dozen yuan. Do you need to deceive consumers in order to attract this business? It is unknown whether their business is connected with the hotel or with Tongcheng! In short, there is concealment and deception, bad review! The sea view room in the hotel is okay, but the buffet is a bit poor, which is still acceptable. I bought other attractions myself, so I won’t go into details.

When I arrived, the hotel said there were no double rooms, but I had booked a double room and had to wait until the waiter came to work to clean it at 9 o'clock. It took me more than ten minutes to arrange the room, but the hotel fee for the hotel I had not stayed in the day before was still charged. The beach manager Liu Dabao was very enthusiastic and told me a lot about the fun places in Sanya! 3. Contact Tongcheng’s customer service. The customer service was very “enthusiastic”, but the result was that the flight was delayed and I had to go to the insurance company myself. The problem of being charged even if I didn’t stay in the hotel for a day could not be solved. 4. The hotel is relatively convenient and cost-effective. The location is convenient and close to the sea, but there is no private beach. If you want a private beach, you can go to the Yalong Bay area. 5. Wuzhizhou Island is quite fun, and you can enjoy many activities with the all-inclusive ticket. Exciting, please pay attention** when booking tickets, you need to confirm many places and need to confirm the ticket in advance 6. In addition, the locals are very enthusiastic and feel good. Most of the route along the No. 25 bus is sea view and beach, which feels very good. 6. The locals say that the ends of the earth are everywhere. It is a holy place for breakups. It is recommended not to go as a couple. Fortunately, I am single. Hahaha. The locals said that Nanshan Temple is very efficacious. You can go there to pray on the last day. I went there on the last day and hoped that I would be favored. In addition, Sanya is very beautiful and has beaches everywhere. Well, every night I go to surf the waves.

3826,3826,"1. After arriving at the airport, more than a dozen people carpooled together. Even after midnight, we had to wait for everyone to arrive before the bus could leave. There was only one seat for each person, and there were no spare seats. Luggage was stuffed into the aisle. The crowding was as conceivable as you can imagine. If you had known better, you would have been there. I took a taxi 2. The purpose was to have a better stay. I booked a superior view room with a great bathtub. It was actually a room on the 3rd floor that was like a home. The decoration couldn't be simpler. The only thing was that the space was big enough. Is there a view room on the 3rd floor? ? The trees are taller than the room 3. And the room smells very musty. Is this a superior room? The front desk of the hotel said that this is the only room available. The money paid by Tongcheng cannot help you upgrade to a suite. I am speechless. It is midnight with a child and I can only endure 4. Respond to Tongcheng customer service. In addition to comforting and reporting to the product department, No other reactions or improvements. 5. I went to the front desk early the next morning and was told that there was a vacant room and I wanted to ask someone to clean it. After waiting for an hour, I moved to the 18th floor. Facing the hotel, it didn't matter as long as there was no musty smell and the wash basin The faucet leaked. I tolerated it. The temperature in the refrigerator was much hotter than the room. I tolerated it, but the toilet was filled with water and the smell was disgusting. The exhaust fan must be turned on all the time and the toilet door must be closed. 6.

3843,3843,"I’m a person who doesn’t usually like to complain, but the hotel I chose for this trip really bothered me... Although the price of the package I chose was not the most expensive, it was still average. 1. Let’s talk about the hotel first. Accommodation, the hotel is very new, the equipment and facilities are also very complete, the most dissatisfied is the service attitude of the hotel front desk, not to mention the service that requires you to be groveling, but there is no at least polite smile, no matter what you ask the front desk for, She kept a straight face as if she owed her millions, and the room types and floors of the hotel were particularly confusing. I’m not sure if the customer service staff on the same trip made a note for me to emphasize that I wanted a high-level hotel, but on the first day I arrived at the hotel, I was initially told to book it. It's a standard room, I said how is that possible? ! Later, I said that I was mistaken. It was a deluxe sea view king bed room, and the hotel gave me a room on the 8th floor (the so-called deluxe sea view room, pictured below). I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights, and saw that it was because of the problem with the room type and floor. There were quite a few guests, and it gave me the feeling that they were just trying to get by. When I met someone who was easy to talk to, I was given a room that didn’t match the actual situation and I could get by. I barely stayed for one night that day and contacted Tongcheng the next day. The customer service helped me deal with it and moved me to the 10th floor. To be honest, I really wanted to check out at that time, but I believe that the customer service of the same process was active in helping me solve the problem because I myself and the hotel reported the situation. At that time, the hotel directly replied that there were no rooms, not even on the upper floor, and the most I could do was change rooms on the same floor (let me explain here, the hotel has a total of 18 floors, and there are shopping mall restaurants below the 5th floor). 2. Let’s talk about the hotel’s food and beverages. I didn’t have breakfast because of my own fault, so I won’t comment. However, I have eaten dinner at several restaurants in the hotel. Apart from a hot pot buffet, it’s okay (hotel guests are better than ** It’s 10 yuan more expensive,). Others really can’t complain. I would like to emphasize that the food in the shopping mall next to it is not as good as the small shops nearby. 3. The rest is to travel to the hotel. I asked the waiter in the lobby if the hotel has a scenic bus. He directly said that he could charter a special bus, but there was no free one. I asked him where there was a bus nearby, and the answer was either no or unclear! Then I took a taxi to go to various scenic spots for a few days. The average round-trip fare to each scenic spot every day was about 200 (basically I could only go to one scenic spot a day), and the average round-trip time was about 2 hours, because This hotel is too far away from various attractions (pictured below). There are also various red lights on the road, so it is not ruled out that taxi drivers will take detours. . . . . . In fact, there are still various problems. I really can’t complain. I just want to say something to Tongcheng. We tourists choose Tongcheng because of a kind of trust. When we go out, we sometimes encounter problems, and we live in different places. Familiar, really helpless and helpless. The airport pick-up and drop-off service on the same journey is very good, and I am also very satisfied with the attitude and efficiency of most customer service issues in handling problems. It is the so-called exclusive one when I started to pay. The customer service, a man, I never contacted him again! The female customer service staff who dealt with it later were really patient!

3844,3844,"First, let’s talk about the itinerary I booked for January 6th. I booked it in early December. At that time, the customer service said that the price might go up in the future. The price I booked at that time was more than 4,200 for one person, about 4,300 with insurance and so on, and 8,600 for two people. Then less than a week later, I looked at the price for the same trip. It dropped by more than 800, to more than 3,500 yuan. For two people, it was more than 6,000, less than 7,000 yuan. I was really speechless. I went to customer service, and they said it was a problem with the ticket, not their same trip. If I cancel If the order is rebooked, the air tickets for two people will cost more than 900 yuan. I haven’t even traveled yet, so I have lost more than 900 yuan in a week. Let’s talk about the itinerary. There are only four people in the whole journey. The tour guide cannot follow us. It’s just the four of us. I was walking alone, and I had a meal problem. I ate twice with a group. After the first meal, I didn’t want to eat the second meal. The second meal was a buffet, which was okay. Generally speaking, the price affected my entire trip.

In the afternoon, we went to Dadonghai to see the sea view and the children played in the sand. The hotel also has a 50-meter-long private beach with beach chairs for lying down and resting. It was very good. The next day I took bus 26 downstairs of the hotel and went to Tianya Haijiao and Nanshan. The ticket to Tianya Haijiao was 100 yuan. I walked around on the beach and saw some big rocks. It is nothing special. On the third day, I went to Monkey Island and Yetian Ancient Village. The tour group reported by the local company was 90 yuan for adults and 50 yuan for children. In addition, the cable car was 20 yuan and the meal was 58 yuan. The meal was in a small village far away. Monkey Island is a place where you can visit. It's very small, so just looking at the little monkeys feels average. The cable car to and from Monkey Island is okay. Across a small river and a hill, you can see the sea and fishing rafts. Yetian Ancient Village is very small, and the village tour guide took us there. The honey-fried shredded coconut inside tastes very good. In addition, there are two shopping spots, and there is no compulsory consumption. On the fourth day, I went to the Nada Tropical Rainforest. The environment inside is good. You can walk on wooden bridges, play trapeze, and climb small waterfalls. On the fifth night flight, we went to the First Market and Pedestrian Street during the day. There are many processed restaurants next to the market. Let’s talk about the Baohong Hotel. Although the standard double rooms are small, they are clean and tidy, and the supporting facilities are quite complete. There is a gym on the first floor, where you can play mahjong in the evening when there are many people. The buffet breakfast and restaurant environment are both very good. The buffet dinner costs 110 yuan per person, and 80 yuan after 8 o'clock is not bad. In addition, the cost of the coastal restaurant in the annex building is not high, so it is also a good choice. Staying at Dadonghai Baohong Hotel is a good choice.",Negative
3846,3846,"This was the most unsatisfactory trip. The tour guide and customer service were very irresponsible. When we dropped off the plane, the tour guide left two numbers, one indicating that the machine was shut down, and the other saying that he was not responsible for our group. I was impatient and contacted the store where I signed up, and the problem was solved. Every day after arriving at the scenic spot, the tour guide let us go in and wander around by ourselves. Other groups had tour guides leading the tour, but we wandered around by ourselves, without any energy. The key was that no one responded during the trip, so we came back to the store. In response, the customer wanted to use a thermos cup to resolve the matter. After the store staff fought for it, he received 200 yuan in compensation. He also said that this was because I was their member, otherwise the company might not give any compensation. I felt sorry for my colleagues. Cheng is completely disappointed and now I just want my membership to be cancelled. I don’t want to deal with such an irresponsible company again. Please don’t be fooled again after reading my review. Tongcheng has no guarantee.",Negative

3848,3848,"The tour guide is not professional enough. After each scenic spot, we can't find the tour guide when we gather at the agreed place. I have never seen tourists keep waiting for the tour guide and driver, and they have to change the itinerary. The flight was delayed and we only arrived in the morning, overnight. We didn't sleep, and we had a baby with us. It was already after 5 o'clock and we had to add an extra itinerary. We wanted to go to Wuzhizhou Island the next day. We wanted to go diving. We asked the tour guide how long it would take. He said one and a half hours, but we waited for more than three hours. It was already past 12 noon there, and we had to meet at the pier at 4:30, and it took more than half an hour to queue up for the boat. We went to Wuzhizhou Island for some diving, but we didn’t go anywhere else. This tour guide was too deceitful. People only think about their own interests",Negative

I did a quick tour on the first day of the trip and went to three places. It was very boring. It cost 30 yuan to take a sightseeing bus in the afternoon. I was tired. We went to Wuzhizhou the next day and it cost 150 to take a sightseeing bus. We just walked around and had no time to do anything. In the evening, we said we would take a yacht and have a drink. What should we drink? 165 Dayang is really a scam. I didn’t eat anything. Let’s talk about the group meal. The place where we ate on the first day was a small shop. The soup we drank was just water from the pot. I wasn’t full. The tour guide recommended the seafood buffet on the second day. There are more than 200 people, but we did not sign up. Those who signed up went to eat first. We could only move around freely near Dadonghai, and then eat. After eating, we could move around freely and wait for the seafood buffet. The group meal can only be said to be edible. It is not at all I couldn’t eat enough. The tour guide kept cheering and his face was full of enthusiasm only when he was selling. The chefs who picked up and dropped off the airport were all very good, very enthusiastic and attentive. It’s true that 52 likes will give you mangoes.",Negative

3862,3862,"I have traveled to Sanya before and it felt very good, so this year I made an appointment with relatives and friends and took my children with me to take this second trip to Sanya. In order to ensure quality, the five-star 0 shopping I reported is purely for fun. However, this trip had mixed feelings. First, the transportation schedule was miserable - it was said that it was raining in Sanya and the plane was delayed. Then after we flew, the in-flight broadcast suddenly said that we could not land because of the typhoon in Sanya and that we could not land! In the past, the tour guides and Tongcheng.com only said it was raining but not the typhoon. There was no clear notification or any targeted measures. They only asked you to passively accept the fact of the typhoon, hovering and circling over Sanya, sometimes free falling, sometimes falling Straight up, sometimes with violent bumps, when the vomiting on the plane is full of pungent smell, when there is a sudden ""ah"" sound of free fall and then suddenly silence, you will have a feeling - you don't know tomorrow Which one comes first, or the accident? For a long hour and a half, it was like this, circling, shouting, smelling, bumping, cold sweat, praying, bumping, repeating the cycle... After hovering in the air for an hour and a half, the plane made an emergency landing in Shenzhen and checked into Shenzhen. Such inaccurate weather forecasts in the South China Sea, and the fact that airlines, tour guides and police deprived us of the right to know about typhoons were clearly a big joke on human life. Why do you know that typhoons are still coming? Why not inform about the typhoon? Have airlines become accustomed to frequent typhoons in Sanya? It would be great if you clearly informed about the typhoon and allowed tourists to choose whether to fly or cancel the trip! Second, the tour guide service is lackluster. There are 41 people in my group. Stayed at several different hotels, picked up all the way, and traveled together. Although the tour guide is young and energetic, when faced with such a large group of people, it is obviously inevitable to focus on one thing and not the other. For example, I didn’t wake up early on the first day. The tour guide said, you have to make an appointment with the hotel to wake up early~ It sounds sour and unpleasant~ Well, I will learn more in the future. During the trip, there were more than 40 people, and the tour guide couldn’t even take care of them! No matter how closely you follow the team, only a small number of people will hear the explanation clearly. Even the tour guide was busy counting people and had no time to explain. Along the way, she was just counting the number of people and moving freely; counting the number of people and getting on the bus; counting the number of people and returning to the hotel, that's all. The explanation is lackluster. Hainan's seafood and fruits have never been explained by the tour guide. In the car, I only heard people talking about this crystal and that crystal. Why are you talking about so many crystals and then taking everyone to a crystal shop? Third, the customer service is simple and rude. Due to the emergency landing of the plane, we were left in the hotel on the first day, so we proposed free activities on the fourth day. We hoped that ** or Tongcheng.com could help us make reasonable arrangements, such as making up for the first day's itinerary. The reply was ""We can't help it, you can find the one-day tour itinerary by yourself"". We are not familiar with the place, but they are so simple, crude and full of spiciness! The above is dissatisfied. Some were satisfied, the accommodation and meals were pretty good. The hotel's customer service, rooms, breakfast, swimming pool, children's playground, book bar, gym, and walking distance to the seaside are very good and give people a sweet vacation experience. In short, there are many typhoons in Sanya, so be careful when traveling!",Negative

3865,3865,"#About Sanya# The sea in Sanya is very beautiful, much clearer and cleaner than Xiamen. This is worthy of recognition, especially Wuzhizhou Island. The Jinghai Hotel is quite satisfactory. The balcony of the 180 sea view room faces the sea. The room is quite big even when the air conditioner is turned on. It has a musty smell, slightly inferior to the Sheraton where we stayed in the same group; (ps. Sheraton's self-service barbecue hot pot is very good, it is recommended to try it) Betel Valley is a bit strange, and the Li and Miao culture is not visible. The tour route is well decorated, except for the clothing. There is no Li-Miao culture, but more of the elders and sisters who sell silverware (ps. The buffet in the scenic spot is simply unpalatable); the sea view of Yalong Bay is not interesting, to be honest, it is not as good as the Sanya Bay Coconut Dream Corridor opposite the hotel, on the water The underwater projects are not as good as Wuzhizhou Island, and the price is relatively cheaper; Wuzhizhou Island is the most meaningful stop in the whole journey. The 120 yuan sightseeing bus around the island is simply a great value. You can see different sea views for a week around the island, and every stop is different. You can stop and play. After you have a good time, you can get on the bus and go to the next stop. You will also receive a beach chair for an hour. The famous scenic spot Tianya Haijiao is just two small stones. One is engraved with Tianya and the other is engraved with Haijiao. It is not good to have small characters. Look for it, but you should just follow it when you see a group of people taking pictures; the Big and Small Cave Sky is even weirder. There is a small hole under a big rock. It is not very clean. Without the words ""Xiao Cave Sky"", I guess not many people will know it. Noticed; (ps. the five-spice peanuts in the health-preserving vegetarian buffet are quite delicious) The local food in Sanya is relatively poor. The specialties are coconut jelly, Qingbu Liang, Wenchang chicken, Baoluo noodles, etc. The main products are the No. 1 Seafood Market and Processing shops are not as good as the food stalls in Xiamen in terms of seafood types and tastes; generally speaking, Sanya is a more suitable place for rest and vacation, and it is not recommended to join a group tour! #AboutBadReview# The negative review is for Tongcheng and has nothing to do with the scenery of Sanya. [Travel Consultant] was very positive before signing the order. After signing the order, he ignored me and didn’t reply to my questions (fortunately, there was no problem). The platform was on duty. The customer service responded very proactively and had a good attitude in handling the problem; [Pick-up] The flight was delayed that day, and the Tianxing pick-up staff at Phoenix Airport immediately contacted the pick-up staff to arrange a vehicle to be sent to the hotel. I would like to express my gratitude! [Tour Guide] Awei was okay. Although he started tricking us on the second day and recommended self-financed items, his attitude was not very tough. It was not easy to go out and eat. In the end, the group members participated in a seafood dinner at their own expense for 220 Yuan/person; [Group Meal] Of the 4 meals arranged in the itinerary, only one dinner was relatively passable. The other three meals were basically terrible. They were all tourist restaurants. The dishes cooked in advance were heated up to taste. It’s also very poor; [Seafood Dinner] The self-funded seafood meal was actually arranged in a hotel that caters for tourist groups. Although there seem to be many types of seafood, the quality of the ingredients and the taste of the dishes are really not worth the price of 2,000 yuan per table; [free of charge] Airport] The hotel is 15 minutes' drive from the airport. The 11:40 a.m. flight had to be sent to the airport at 9 a.m. The driver was chewing betel nuts along the way. The smell made me feel bad all morning.",Negative

3868,3868,"Bad review. I may have met a fake exclusive tour guide. During the trip, I just thought, haha, but it was not helpful at all. First, they recommended us delay insurance and told us wrong information. They said that if the total reaches four hours, we can admire the delay insurance. , we took it for granted that the return flight was delayed for more than four hours. Later we found out that delay insurance can only be paid if the outbound flight is delayed for more than four hours at a time. As it turned out, our flight was really delayed for six hours, so we What should I do if I contact a dedicated tour guide? Should we apply for insurance first and prepare the materials, but the exclusive tour guide said that we should come back and apply again, and he would apply for insurance for us. We felt at ease, but what was the result? After returning home, we were asked to prepare this and that. I would like to ask, if we did not pay attention to saving the information at that time, would the delay insurance we bought have been in vain? Why didn't you tell us that the delay insurance claims process was so complicated? An even more bizarre thing happened. Our plane was originally scheduled to take off at 22:40 on June 5. Because the flight was delayed until 4:46 on June 6, we arrived in Sanya at 7:59 pm on June 6. It's late, we understand, after all, the plane is delayed, it has nothing to do with the master, but what we can't understand is why we waited for an hour when we arrived at Sanya Bay Lanhai Holiday Apartment at 9:30! ! !

We didn't stay in the hotel and the reservation was cancelled. What about my room rate for that day? Should you refund me? I don’t live in your apartment? Why do you charge me room fee? In other words, since I paid for the room in advance, why do you cancel my hotel reservation? ! After finally checking into the apartment at 11 o'clock, I hehe again! The TV was broken, the refrigerator was broken, and the wifi was broken. The only good thing was the air conditioner. We initially asked to change rooms, but the front desk refused and said they would help us fix the wifi. However, it took two days to repair but it still wasn't fixed. It was inside the wifi. The line is broken! I just want to ask, when I travel to Sanya, can the hotel I stay in have no internet connection? ? Finally, at our strong request, we were given a room change. At this time, we had been delayed for two days. When we entered the new room, we realized that the front desk had arranged for us the best room at first. The best room was Leave it to the difficult guests later? In other words, if we have a good temper, can we only be bullied by Sanya? ? It's too bullying.

First of all, the customer service staff of the same trip called me the day before the trip to tell me that the group we signed up was not available and asked me to postpone the start of the trip by one day because I had already made an appointment with a friend in Sanya. So I can’t postpone it, and then the customer service told me that the itinerary will go on as usual according to the travel notice, but it may be just the two of us, okay, you have to inform me one day before the trip that there is no group. What are you thinking? Forget it. I don’t care about it anymore. There was a little hiccup in booking the hotel. I won’t go into details about this. It’s not the main point. The most important thing is that it is very important for the tour guide to come out to travel with the group. There are 7 people in our group, three groups of families, and they live separately. In three different hotels, the tour guide and driver are the same person. After all, it is a small group, so it is understandable that they are the same person. However, as a tour guide, I did not wear a tour guide card during the whole process. As a driver, I would give it 80 points, but as a tour guide, I would give it 80 points. Sorry, the tour guide can only give me 15 points. I was drunk. If the tour guides on the same journey are all of this level, I can basically say goodbye to the tourism industry. As a driver, there is no problem. Driving every day is quite hard, but as a tour guide, it is really hard. Well... I originally thought about forgetting it and not commenting on it, but I still feel uncomfortable thinking about it. Sanya feels too commercial to me. The service at the Shengyi Hotel where you stayed was very considerate, and the cleaning lady was also very considerate. I would like to give you a thumbs up. My Tongcheng exclusive consultant is also good. If I have any problems, he will report them and solve them in time. By the way, there was also the final drop-off to the airport, which was quite scary. We were talking about sex almost the whole time.

""The hotel's star rating is accurate to 5 stars. When we arrived at the hotel, the waiter said that it would take five years to stay. I checked online that the hotel has been in service for more than five years."" After our strong request, we were changed to the original one. The hotel I booked had ""sufficient hotel rooms"", so that's why the hotel was cheated. Next, let’s talk about the group meals. The ones that cost a little extra are not bad, but the ones that don’t cost a little are really unpalatable and tasteless. The only thing that is good for my mood is the scenery of Sanya, which is beautiful. 1 and 2 refer to standard rooms in 5-star hotels (disposable slippers need to be purchased). 3, 4 and 5 refer to separately paid stage play tickets. 6 and 7 refer to the scenery of Tianya Haijiao. 8 and 9 refer to the scenery of Wuzhizhou Island.",Negative

It took me a long time to call but someone came late. From now on, I will not fly China Southern Airlines unless absolutely necessary. Except for the sea view, Tianyu Hotel is similar to a three-star hotel in every other aspect. The hotel decoration/facilities/services are too poor, the catering is inferior, and the price is seriously inconsistent. The price of a five-star hotel is two-star. The hotel advertises free airport transfers when applying for a membership card, but there is still a fee for hailing a taxi.

It is recommended that everyone book flights online on the official website in the future! I would like to ask Tongcheng: Why was the flight canceled and no one notified me? If you ask me to book a flight by myself, I will bear all the losses caused by the flight tickets and hotels. Who will dare to book travel on your website in the future? What kind of high-end tour is this! It’s so irritating! The flight was cancelled, I bought 50 insurance, and the insurance company paid 100. Other than that, there is no apology.

The outbound flight's historical on-time rate is only 3%, without any notice, and it was delayed by 5 hours. We originally arrived at the hotel at 11 pm, but arrived at 4 am. With the children, there was no way to carry out the next day's itinerary as planned. At the same time, Cheng should at least give a reminder. Whether it is on-time performance or delay information, there is nothing. If I know the on-time performance, I can change the flight. Tong Cheng said that they have no responsibility or obligation. You are unlucky! The plan originally only had three days, but one day was omitted. Tongcheng said that even if you arrive at the hotel the next day, it has nothing to do with them; in short, after paying the money, you will become a grandson immediately. Speaking of money, I was really bored at the airport on my way there. I checked which website I went to, and suddenly I found that the same flight and hotel were much cheaper if I booked them myself. I was really disappointed. I felt like I had been cheated. I blamed myself. The order was placed too quickly. I originally wanted to have a quick trip (from decision to order payment, it only took half an hour), but I had to suffer the consequences. The return trip was even funnier, the flight was at 9:10 a.m. and the flight was at 6 a.m. After getting up and washing up, I was getting ready to leave. Tongcheng sent a text message saying that the flight would be rescheduled to 1:30 pm (Tongcheng said they had no responsibilities and obligations, but they reminded me on the return trip, which is contradictory), so I had to wait in the room until 11:00. I checked out and set off, and arrived at the airport at 11:30. I found that the flight was changed to 12:30, and I was very pressed for time. The luggage check-in said that the luggage might be on the next flight, and maybe it could only be picked up tomorrow. I felt like crying without tears; (good Later, my luggage caught up, and I felt little comfort); the flight ended up being delayed by 8 hours. Tongcheng's attitude is chilling. Who knows who is fooled? The purpose of finding a prostitute is to save trouble and save money. In the end, it is not about saving trouble. You have to do all the homework yourself.

On the day we went to Wuzhizhou Island, because all the members of the group were not in the same hotel, it was already noon when we picked up all the people and arrived at Wuzhizhou Island. If you want to participate in self-funded activities, you should sign up with the tour guide. The tour guide asked my traveling companions and asked us what activities we should sign up for. My teammates asked if coral reef diving was fun, and I asked if my clothes would get wet while diving. I didn't bring any spare clothes today, nor did I bring a swimsuit. I also asked if there would be a long queue? The tour guide said that he would not get wet and would wear a diving suit. There won't be long queues. So I signed up for the coral reef diving project, which costs 580 yuan per person. Pay the money to get the sign, and then go get the diving clothing. The clothes the clothes giver gave us were very wet inside and out, so we just shook them off and put them on. Then get dressed and go to training first. After the training, we bought 2 packs of fish food and disposable breathing mouths. Fish food is 10 yuan per pack, and disposable breathing mouths are 20 yuan each. Then we ran to the coral reef diving gathering place and took us to an area on the sea. After waiting for about 2 hours, I felt dizzy from the shaking on the boat. It was our turn, so I went into the water, stepped on the sea with my two feet, and slowly brought my body close to the sea. I felt my underwear getting wet immediately after brushing it. The instructor helped me wear diving glasses. During the training, he clearly said that there are special diving glasses for myopia. I said I was short-sighted, and the coach said just wear this, it’s the same. Isn't this deception? My body slowly felt like my bra was getting wet in the sea. Within a minute, I said I wasn’t going to dive anymore. The coach said that the money would not be refunded as long as we came down. Each of us spent 610, which is like a waste of 610. So I'm really disappointed with this trip. You said that if the tour guide asked us to pay for the items at our own expense, you would recommend something that would prevent our clothes from getting wet, regardless of other people's feelings. It's just about letting tourists spend money anyway, right? You said that I was a girl who really didn’t wear any underwear until she returned to the hotel in the evening. I only wear a wet bra, and I can’t walk on the road without wearing it after taking it off.",Negative
3901,3901,"First of all, they didn’t send us back to the hotel within half an hour when we got off the plane in Sanya. It took us a full hour and a half to arrive at the hotel. Secondly, when we placed the order, we clearly stated that we should book two rooms next to each other. It doesn’t matter if there are not two double rooms, as long as there is one. A standard room with a double bed is fine, but when you arrive at the hotel, the rooms are neither together nor a double room. The so-called double bed is two small beds pushed into one, which completely affects your mood. Why didn't you specify that there is no double bed in this order? , it was stated that I could make other choices and then they were transferred together. I stayed there for nine consecutive days without losing my temper. In addition, the itinerary was very busy. It only took one hour and forty minutes from the entrance to the gathering at Tianya Haijiao. Each person spent 300 yuan to see Qiangu Qingzong in just over three hours. If he went by himself, he could at least enjoy two or three more hours. In an hour, I basically visited all the scenic spots. Needless to say about the food, the group meal was generally difficult to swallow. I relied on the restaurant to promote the free sauce and food to eat.

Unfortunately, when I arrived at the airport at 5.30, Tongcheng told me that the ticket was not issued successfully! Next, Tongcheng sent a few messages, saying that there are no rescheduled flights today, only tomorrow, and tomorrow will only be in the afternoon and evening.

The customer service on the same journey said that there was no flight that night and could only be rescheduled to tomorrow night! They asked me to pay the price difference of more than 400 per person. I didn't agree at the time and asked them to find another way. After all, it was not my fault, so why should I take the money? Later, Tongcheng stopped talking to me... Until after 8 o'clock, Yangzijiang Airlines took the initiative to find a hotel for our stranded guests, provided dinner and breakfast, and rescheduled the flights for the next day.

I hurriedly called Tongcheng again, but the customer service staff kept using the excuse that they couldn't get through... They couldn't get through for three hours? I am really convinced, using this reason! In desperation, I called to complain again and provided my parents' phone numbers. Then I arranged a flight at 5 o'clock the next day. There was still a price difference of more than 100 per person, so I didn't ask for it! I'm really angry. If they didn't give me a refund, I would have returned to Shanghai long ago! As a result, I ate lunch and dinner by myself the next day, and the flight was delayed until 9 pm. It was already early Sunday morning when I got home!

You have to go early for diving in Wuzhizhou, otherwise you will have to wait for a long time. There are many water sports there, and of course the prices are not cheap. Yanoda has zip lines and waterfall paddling. Tickets for waterfall paddling must be purchased at the gate. They are not sold elsewhere. There are many plants. It is best to hire a tour guide to introduce the plants to you. Otherwise, you won’t be able to see and understand the vegetation. Each person has an electronic guide, which can sometimes be a bit laggy. The first seafood market to eat is bought by the clerk at the processing store. The seafood is very fresh.

However, Tongcheng customer service said that there was a two-month difference between the booking time and the travel time, and they could not confirm the room type with the hotel. So I asked Tongcheng consultant to help arrange a room with sea view in advance (with ** records as evidence). But it wasn't until we arrived in Sanya to check in that we discovered that the two rooms we booked for four nights were both facing the north and didn't have any sea view. So I immediately contacted Tongcheng.com, but repeated calls to no avail. Tongcheng insisted that it still could not arrange a sea view room. As a last resort, I had to communicate with the hotel, and after adding a room difference of 200 yuan per room, I finally changed to a sea view room on the last night. The most dissatisfying thing about this incident is that in the nearly two months from the reservation to the trip, no staff from Tongcheng contacted me about the room arrangement. I can understand if I informed you in advance, after all, there is no such thing in the contract. Specify that it must be a sea view room. It means that their previous promise to help me arrange a sea view room was pure deception! Tongcheng didn't do anything to make arrangements for me, he just took the money and let it go. After I contacted Tongcheng on the phone, they still couldn't resolve it, which seriously ruined our mood for the trip. This is an incident that Tongcheng, as a big travel brand, should not happen! The purpose of travel arrangements is to allow consumers to fully enjoy the process in a good mood, not to ruin the mood of tourists! Even if the same party proposed to add some room difference for this room arrangement, we would still be able to accept it. After all, the room difference is only a small part, and the purpose of going out is to put us in a good mood. As long as Tongcheng can truly consider the perspective of our consumers and truly help us solve our problems, both parties can reach a consensus through negotiation. Instead of blindly shirking responsibility like the Tongcheng consultants showed in this room arrangement incident, an attitude that did not consider tourists at all! ! ! I have been a member of Tongcheng.com since it was first established, and have traveled through Tongcheng many times. However, the current Tongcheng service has greatly regressed compared to the previous service! In the future, I will choose the services provided by other travel service providers again, and I also recommend that tourists choose carefully when traveling. Currently, there are too many travel service providers to choose from for us consumers, and we have more room for choice. At the same time, it is also recommended that Tongcheng can improve through this incident and not let similar unpleasant incidents happen to tourists again.

The customer service said that I cannot change the ticket after I have booked it. Changes will require change fees, and cancellations will require liquidated damages. I personally reduced the price by a thousand yuan. A few days before departure, there was another activity on this trip, and it was 200 yuan cheaper for two people. I contacted customer service and told them that because they had booked in advance, they could not participate in the activity. So I would like to know, does it mean that the earlier you book, the more expensive it is? Air tickets are expensive and I can’t participate in activities. After consultation, I was told that I can only send a box of fruit at the airport. It’s a small box, about five kilograms. How can I feel balanced? Let’s talk about the itinerary. The normal four days include one day of free activities. The first day at Wuzhizhou Island is pretty good. The second and third days are spent most of the time on the road. You can only spend an hour or two at each scenic spot, and there is nothing. Beautiful and super tiring. Let’s talk about group meals. I’ve been to many places before, including self-guided tours and group meals. It’s the first time I’ve had such an unpalatable meal. I don’t know how hungry I can be without food when traveling. I’m not picky, it’s really unpalatable. . The place where I stayed was only okay for one night. It was probably an apartment. It was very far from the city. I didn’t have enough to eat and I didn’t even have to order takeout. I stayed in a very old hotel for three nights in a row. I didn’t get wet in the shower and only had a shower. That kind of thing. It's still on the beach. Because it's close to the sea, it's also facing the street. It feels like sleeping on the street. You can clearly hear the passing vehicles. The sound insulation effect is very poor. I was woken up by people outside the door at around 11 o'clock in the middle of the night. But I still can't take the bus. It's convenient.

I wrote about zero shopping. In fact, their routines are quite deep. I will pave the way for you along the way. I will tell you how to wear silver on the way to Binlang Valley. When you arrive, you will stay at the place where you buy silver for a long time, and the scenic spots are too busy! When we entered Nanshan, the tour guide asked us to find a guide. Very happy at first. We all enjoyed listening to what the instructor said. In fact, in the end, we were asked to buy amulets. It was all a routine. Even after purchasing, the guide disappeared! The locals know that West Island is the most fun and the only tourist attraction without shopping. But the tour group will not take us there because there is no commission! The trip is over. The tour guide said that if you get a five-star review, you can go to the airport to pick up a box of fruit. I believe 99% of people will give a good review for this box of fruit and will not write their true thoughts. The tour guide said that the ticket for Qianguqing is 300 yuan per person. The same goes for children, and I was charged right away without any time to think about it. Later, I searched Taobao for only 250 yuan, and children got a 20% discount. The group meal was really unpalatable, dirty, smelly, and the environment was bad. In summary, Tongcheng still needs to work hard, and there are still many things to change.",Negative

If there was no place to sit, I would probably be tanned. (In One thing to mention, from picking us up to the Tianya Haijiao scenic spot, the whole journey was 15km. We drove for more than an hour without any traffic jams. Then we kept selling crystals in the car. You know the process. 😌) Everything else was fine. I won’t be there next time.

Because the exit was unclear, I asked a few questions about the pick-up location. The pick-up man looked impatient and had a very aggressive attitude. It was already past 10 o'clock when I arrived at the hotel that night. When I arrived at the hotel, it turned out to be the Mangrove Coconut Grove Hotel, not the Kapok Hotel. Forget it. I was booked on the 7th floor. As soon as I entered the room, a strong smell hit my nostrils. Generally, hotels don’t have this kind of smell coming from people who have never stayed there. There was a musty smell and the bathtub was not there. I contacted the front desk and said that I had booked a superior room. They kindly asked me to change it to a deluxe room. Are you kidding me? The one without a bathtub is called a deluxe room, and the one with a bathtub is called a superior room? After thinking about it, I tidied up and went to bed. I just stepped on the ground with my bare feet and walked a few steps. My darling feet, how dirty they are. How many days have they not been mopped? This means that no one has lived in this room for a long time. Is it possible that the smell is so strong? I contacted Tongcheng. I have been waiting for a long time as promised by the customer service. The final reply they gave me was that it would be handled tomorrow. Everyone is out there and I am not familiar with the place. I can only contact your customer service. The matter has not been handled. Will you stay in such a dirty room tomorrow? ?I found the hotel's front desk and quickly helped me to arrange a transfer to the 17th floor. I said that I had taken care of it myself. The customer service staff actually said that it was better to go to the trouble and give me a 5-star review. ? Will I give you a good review? Do you think that's possible? The flight came back on the 21st. It was already early in the morning when I got home. I asked customer service if I could change my flight. One customer service said it was ok and I had to pay the difference. The other said no and I had to pay the difference. Why did one of them have the same idea? I believed it and called the customer service and asked the customer service. They said yes and they gave you half an hour to answer but there was no word. I went through these things. I will never join a same-tour group again. Even my friends around me will not suggest that they join a same-ride group. I have no sense of responsibility at all.

Urgent, it is recommended that those with children do not join the group. After returning, the flight delay insurance was not processed in time, and I had to call to settle the claim.

Is that called a fast food buffet? I really have a strong opinion on the hotel I stayed in. Don’t say five stars. I thought the Xinjiang Building I stayed in had two stars. I laughed. Why do I say that? Because it’s in Sanya. Accommodation itself is not expensive. The seven-star Phoenix Island Hotel only costs around 400 to stay in.

The order was obviously placed through the Tongcheng app. They still don’t admit that the platform showed that the red envelope coupons can be used the day before ordering, and they ask us to provide screenshots of the order? Could it be that we both read it wrong before placing an order? This trip was really full of twists and turns. I made so many customer service calls.

Today I will talk about the situation I encountered. First of all, we booked a free trip plus a 2-day solo trip. The travel itinerary is equivalent to a semi-free travel. Before booking, I emphasized to the customer service that we need to find a good tour guide because we were afraid of being cheated and the tour guide was not professional. The team had a poor tour experience. The customer service insisted on making sure that we rest assured. The result was infuriating. First of all, I will not talk about the first. There is nothing wrong with booking air tickets and accommodation. Everyone has their likes or dislikes without comment. However, on the first day of the 2-day tour, the tour guide came to take us around without any flags or microphones. As a result, he could not explain anything to us at all during the tour. I couldn’t hear the news. On the second day, I was told that I wanted to go to Wuzhizhou Island. In the car, I told us that the water sports on the island are fun. They told us how much the original price was and that their company offered a discount package for only 1,399. We could only apply for the island and the price. The only thing is that VIP projects can be played as you like and repeated, and there is no need to queue up. Our team signed up for 9 tickets. Some people said that it is indeed faster to get to the island, and it is indeed faster than ordinary tourists. But after getting to the island, I found out that they all bought this ticket. There was a long queue like everyone else** Our tour guide finished the formalities at 12 noon and we only went to the island at 5 o'clock. We had to leave the island at 5 o'clock. We had a meal at noon and started playing at 1 o'clock. In the end, our team basically only did one project, which was diving. I only spent all my money on one project",Negative

Later, we contacted Tongcheng's customer service before sending us back. After that, the tour guide's expression was not very good. A ticket online was 188 and the tour guide charged 280. On the second night, we were asked to add 150 extra meals per person and four famous dishes. The potential consumption was too much. The tour guide called Cao Shaoling. She often talked about some Feng Shui superstitions during the trip. She personally believed in them too much.

After paying, the customer service called again and said that I needed to add 77 yuan per night because it was 3 plus 1!

When we changed the time, he said he also wanted to rest and asked us to take a taxi back to the hotel at his expense. Later, he came to pick us up and take us back to the hotel during the day. The hotel we booked was generally pretty good, but it originally said three bedrooms and three bathrooms instead of two. Wei, I contacted the consultant and he helped me solve it. Later, he gave me two pots of fruit, which were actually just a little bit of lychee and lotus mist. The lotus mist was so sour. Later, I asked for two quilts and got them for free. ""One quilt is 50 yuan."" However, the inner toilet in the master bedroom is really smelly. Yes, the supermarket downstairs in Building E is not expensive, and you can rent a swimming ring for ten yuan a day.

I heard that the first market is too expensive! We went to Dadonghai and spent a day on a cruise ship. It’s 180 yuan per person, but I paid 150 yuan per person to go to the second floor, which is no fun. Speaking of many projects, in fact, diving costs 60 yuan to buy a mouthpiece.

But the equipment forced us to It was shot in black and white, and I was a little bit fooled."" The time on the motorboat was very short. It cost 20 yuan to take a photo! Nanshan Temple cost 140 yuan. We were really drunk. We listened to a fake monk’s story, but we didn’t listen. We took a sightseeing bus for 30 yuan and ate vegetarian dishes. The entrance fee was too expensive, only a few stones. Finally, I went to the duty-free city, which I can only say was not cheap. Came back early for personal reasons. The hotel fee was not refundable, and the air ticket was refunded and repurchased. I lost some money. I didn't go to Wuzhizhou Island because I had a baby, and more importantly, it was too hot. As soon as I stepped out of the house, I was sweating, including Betel Valley, and I didn’t go to many places. There is no drop-off service and it is close to the airport.

The hotel learned that the sea view angle of this superior sea view room is only 30-50 degrees. So I spent more money at the hotel and upgraded to a deluxe view room in the second phase for two nights. What I didn’t expect was that the so-called superior sea view room I booked in the same trip for the next two nights was so bad. I couldn’t imagine this.

Later, I learned through passers-by that we should take a group with the same route, which is less crowded, comfortable, and has good service. This group was really screwed up. It was the first day to go to the tropical rainforest. , there were many mosquitoes, and there was no place to sit. The tour guide dropped us off at the door, and then we were led by a local tour guide. In the evening, the tour guide recommended that we go to Songcheng Eternal Love and Seafood Package at our own expense. Songcheng is very fun, but the tour guide let us in at 7. 9. We came out, everyone else had finished the day, and it was a waste. Then we talked about the seafood set meal. I originally wanted to go to the first market by myself, but the tour guide insisted on saying that it was not good, and then praised the seafood set meal to the extreme. As a result, , I learned from passers-by that the Tongcheng special line is free. We spent 220, but in the end, there were only 100 people in the group. Of course, the extra money was made by the tour guide. As for the food, it was pitiful. They cost tens of dollars in Zhenjiang, and you can eat them anywhere. It’s so hot outdoors, so the so-called seafood dinner is boiled shrimps in a pot of water. You know the cost. The next day Wuzhizhou Island is crazy expensive and there are no places to do it. In Hainan, if you step on the sand, you have to pay to use the toilet to get water. The Wuzhizhou Island light diving costs 580 and queues for half a day. The pass is 1599 and only costs 1080 online. As a result, the tour guide told us that the ones purchased online could not be used, and we had to pay him 80 yuan per person. I could only laugh. Anyway, the tour guide really didn’t take us to play at all. He just talked a few nonsense on the bus and then collected the money. All the sightseeing tours were led by local tour guides. Yalong Bay is also a beach, and you can also go diving. However, we were left here for just one hour, and we had to go to Wuzhizhou Island for diving. Why do you know, the tour group that Tongcheng Express does? , the price is the same as ours. They gave us a night tour of Sanya Bay, a seafood feast, and mango Bluetooth headsets. We got nothing but met a cheating tour guide. Then I wanted to buy coconut water on the roadside. The tour guide refused to buy it and insisted on us. When I went to the supermarket, I was told that there would be pick-ups on the roadside, but I learned through passers-by that coconuts on the roadside only cost 5 yuan each. This place joked that it cost 0 yuan, but in fact, I spend money every day. 1,000 a day is too little, and some people may They say you don’t have to go to those places that are paid for at your own expense. Let’s put it this way, if you spend a day on Wuzhizhou Island, if you don’t do the projects, how can you spend a day soaking in the sea? And there is no place to sit, so you can only enjoy the activities. Those tour guides that don’t pay you will let you wear it for one hour, and Songcheng Fun will let you wear it for two hours, so you should find a group with the same journey, of course. If you have good physical strength, don’t want to take photos, and don’t need money, just go with us and bring a towel with toilet water. Let’s talk about the prices here. A piece of green pepper and potato shreds in an ordinary restaurant costs more than 20 yuan, let alone a steamed bun in a scenic spot. You know, 6 yuan. If you book this tour, it is recommended not to participate in the eternal love and seafood feast mentioned by the tour guide. Go by yourself. Go to the first market to buy the seafood feast, otherwise you will be like me. , drove to Hainan, not only did I have fun, but I also couldn’t eat well. I didn’t eat any authentic seafood and fruits. Finally, let me say it again, I am not the kind of person who gives back 25 yuan for a good review. I definitely want the real thing.

I feel that this group tour is not only tiring, but just a quick tour and not much fun. After getting off the plane on the first day, we arranged to stay at a Qinghai hotel. It was too close to the airport and the planes were loud when sleeping at night. The next day, we visited two places with the group. The first stop was Yalong Bay and the second stop was Wuzhizhou Island. When I signed up for the group, I saw that the itinerary was 9:00. In fact, the meeting was at 8:00. I didn’t make it clear when I signed up for the group. I arrived at my destination at 9:00, which is actually very far. I arrived at Yalong Bay after 10:00. The tour guide only gave me more than half an hour to look at it. It was just a look. The time was very tight. I felt that it was arranged to enrich the name of the itinerary. The basic time Don’t even think about playing anything if you’re too pressed. Wuzhizhou Island is very big and can be visited for a day, but you have to take a boat after arriving. It was already around 11:30 when we started playing. The tour guide asked us to take the boat back to the bus at 4:20, and we only did one diving project. After more than 2 hours, we were already queuing up to take the boat around 3:40 in the afternoon. Who knew that we had to queue for an hour and a half to get on the boat? It was already 5:30 when we arrived on the other side. The tour guide contacted me and said that he could not wait for me. I also expressed his understanding. . We, a family of three, took a taxi back by ourselves. The taxi to Qinghai Hotel cost 120 yuan. It feels like taking a taxi in Sanya to go to tourist attractions is around 100 yuan. Go back to the hotel and solve the problem of eating by yourself. I feel so tired from following this group. Can I discuss with the tour guide not to join the group? The tour guide said yes, and then the family of three decided to spend 300 yuan to change to the Shengyi Hotel in the city, so they no longer have to listen to the noise of airplanes. In fact, Tibet Tower Hotel and Qinghai Hotel are both together, so the hotel arranged by ** is near the airport. If you can accept the sound of planes at night, you can stay there. Every day after I am not with the group, I have a lot of free time. Finally, I don’t have to go to visit just to put together a tourist attraction, and it’s not fun at all. I suggest you think carefully after reading what I posted. If you want to have a lot of fun, you should go it alone and don’t join a group. . It's not fun to play in a group at all.",Negative

Of course, the weather was irresistible. However, the tour guide was very dedicated to the self-funded projects, and other arrangements were perfunctory. It is recommended that you travel independently in the future and not join a group. Everything in a group tour is more expensive than booking from outside. And you can't question this, otherwise it will be very ugly to be popular.
